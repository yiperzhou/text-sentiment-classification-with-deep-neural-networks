Having been in the air FOREVER with 3 layovers all I wanted was FOOD and PROTEIN and Georgina led me right to their clever 'automat' set-up where I scarfed down a yummy sandwich wrap, etc. Feeling revived, we headed up to our lovely room and then out the door to get our first glimpse of Las Ramblas which is SO close. Casa Camper is beautifully located and the staff goes out of its way to give you info on wherever to want to go and whatever you want to see. And the chef! Well, words can't even begin to describe the breakfasts but if you go away hungry then there is something seriously wrong with YOU!

However, we really loved our stay in Hotel Alba. The hotel is 3* in that it is a little tired in its decor in places however the room was of a very good size, there was a fridge, chairs, suitcase stand and a comfy double bed. The bathroom was also of a very good size. Everywhere was neat and clean. The rooms were cleaned every day with new towels and new bedding every day which was unnecessary but lovely all the same! The cleaners and reception staff were very friendly and helpful we even got a little present of turrón as we left. The location is superb - 2 minutes from the metro Liceu and from Las Ramblas. Yes this does make it loud outside at night - but if you do the same amount of exploring and walking as us in the day- you will sleep regardless. Plus the room has great air conditioning that we didn't even open the windows or use the balcony even with the weather being 30/31C. Yes, the side street is probably used for certain indecent activities but this is Spain and the streets, even this one, is busy at gone 11:30, and there are plenty of people walking about. The hotel is keycard access only and there was always a friendly smiley face at the desk to great you when you were heading out or coming back. You need to be safe around the whole of this area for Pick Pockets etc, but there is no reason to be too concerned about the area for it to ruin your holiday.

I was unable to pay with my travel credit card (loaded with Euros), as it came up on the payment screen with the option to pay in my jo currency. I said no as I didn't have any of my home currency on the card, just Euros, but they wouldn't accept it. I had to go down the road and get cash out (costing me fees) instead of using my card like I normally would (in every other place). It seems like the owner runs his business before the computer was invented, with piles of folders behind the desk with all the paperwork. I felt sorry for the girls working there! Another issue we had was that our room was in another part of the building, so we had to pass through two locked doors (with difficult locks) to get to our room. We also had no way of looking outside, as we had double windows (open one to reveal more frosted glass), which was very claustrophobic!!

Only thing I would criticise is the size of the bathroom but then again, we got what we paid for. Shower was never one temperature but that was okay for me as it was so hot I couldn't decide if I wanted a cold or warm shower! If you want a good night's sleep then take ear plugs!

Once I arrived, they told me there were no rooms for me as they'd accidentally overbooked. Now this is annoying but I know all hotels do it, so I can't fault them for this. They did give us free drinks and taxi'd us to another hotel relatively close by. They had told me to get a receipt from the other hotel for breakfast so that they can refund me too. This was all sounding great. Even gave me a card with a number to call in the morning so they could arrange a taxi to take our bags back over and put them in the room for us.So morning comes around. I get my receipt, call the number on the card and i'm met with ""This number has not yet been assigned to an agent"". The staff at the Illunion hotel were fantastic and helped get in touch with the Sansi hotel, only to find out that they had no record of me needing a room, or for them to pick up my stuff. After a bit of back and forth and the Sansi staff calling a manager, they realised they were supposed to give me a room and pick us up. We dropped our bags off and headed out for the day. The Sansi Hotel is in a great location (25 minute walk to the docks). Upon returning to the hotel, we checked in and I asked about the refund. The person on the front desk told me they had heard nothing about getting a refund and would need to talk to a manager, then they would get back to me. They then went and got our bags out of a back cupboard (the bags we were told would be left in our new room). The guy then told us to wait in reception whilst they checked for a room. It seemed as if he was searching the bottom floor for a room that was vacant, as if they didn't know where they'd put me. We got in to the room. Got settled and went to sleep. The room itself seemed very modern. I've seen a lot of complaints about space, the room wasn't huge but fine for what it was. Very nice bathroom. Overall very clean. The only downside was the view. All we could see was a concrete courtyard and directly across from our room was the breakfast area. So we needed the curtains closed at all times otherwise people could just peer in. The aircon doesn't really work. It keeps the room at a solid 23 degrees. At least it turns on though, I can only imagine how unbearable the heat would have been without it. Also, the wifi is terrible. I didn't go on holiday to sit on the internet, would have been nice to be able to load up maps or websites for things to do though. Ended up using my own mobile data which was only getting a ""H+"" signal, which was still faster than their wifi. We get up and head out for our second day of barcelona sun. When we get back there's a new person on the desk, who when I ask about the refund says the same as the first. It's as if the staff just pack in their shift and head home without leaving any notes for any one else. As we headed towards our room on the ground floor, we noticed our room door was wide open. So I head back to reception to ask when the cleaners were in because they've left our door open. The staff member came down to the door and starts to open and close it to show that it works. Clearly not understanding what I meant. After a few rounds of the door being opened and closed, he finally understood that someone had left it wide open, potentially all day. Their only response was ""Do you not use the safe?"". Well yes, but I don't put everything in there. Anyone could have came in to the room, it's just off the reception so staff would have thought nothing of someone walking in and out.They said they'd speak to the cleaners and ask them to be more careful. After overbooking my room, not being able to give me a refund. Forgetting to come get our luggage and then our room being wide open, we were just done. There was clearly no point in talking to the staff as they just didn't care to actually follow anything up. Any other hotel would have offered some compensation but it was struggle to even get them to say sorry. Every time we went past reception there was someone complaining about something. I feel very bad for the staff, as someone of them seem great. The majority are disinterested with very poor customer service ability. It wasn't until we were checking out that we finally got our refund. They actually asked for the receipt which I'd already handed in a week earlier. Then couldn't find it. We only got the money back due to simply waiting them out. By far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It may be in a great location but the price would warrant a nice relaxing time. Instead we were stressed from start to finish, with no confidence in the staff. Really, reaaally look around before booking here.

Located next to its upscale sister, ""The Colon"", for a fraction of the price.We took a taxi from the airport for 29€ and were dropped off at the square, steps away from the front of the hotel. I was concerned about other hotels located on closed narrow, hidden streets, and was relieved to see the Regencia so close and visible from the street and square.In fact, that is the beauty and genius of this hotel, it is 25 metres from the main square. Within 60 seconds you are in the middle of everything that is Barcelona. We arrived and walked straight down to the beach (15-20 mins). But it felt even shorter as we wandered through the Gothic Quarter, down past the pier, and onto sandy beach.The Rambla and lunch at the Boqueria were 10 mins away. So is the open public square, Placa Reial, where we had dinner. It was a longer walk to the Sagrada the next day (30 mins), but time passed quickly as we strolled up Passeig de Gracia to view the architecture and visit the shops. Next time, we'll take the Metro back from the Sagrada to Placa de Catalunya. The location was key, as we came back to the hotel for late afternoon siestas before heading out for dinner.But, this is a review of the hotel, not a travel guide. And so, let me say that check-in was made very easy and welcoming by Anselmo. We were in room 155. Right above the Hotel Regencia sign. It was comfortable, clean and quiet. See attached picture.I was travelling with my young daughter and safety was a key concern at night. We felt very safe and regularly sat in the square with a gelato watching public performances and dancing with 100's of other tourists before crossing to the other side of the square and retiring to the comfort and close proximity of the Regencia.Price was important to us, and we were able to secure a fee well under most comparable hotels, for such a prime location. And as you can see, wifi is critical for young guests!

So, when we arrived, we were greeted by room temp of 31 degrees C. How nice. - no minibar. If you are thirsty during the night you have to convince the night guardian to sell you a bottle- no gym- the usual low pressure water from shower head- icing on the oddness-cake: they close the nice roof terrace + small pool when they feel like it, with no real reason. Very light rain in the morning of July 8, it then stopped at lunch time and in the afternoon and weather turned to sunny spells. At 6pm no chance to access the roof terrace. When asked, the receptionist said they keep lounge chairs covered with plastic to avoid them getting wet. And he told me it reopens at manager's discretion, likely the next day. Likely...Furnishing a roof outdoor terrace with pool lounge chairs that get damaged by water is doubtlessly an intelligent decision, but closing the nicest feature of this b&b until a lazy manager ends his siesta and trudges across the stairs to re open it...this is really the stroke of genius.It is a pity because at more reasonable rates (available during the weekdays at 170 usd/night for the smaller rooms), this ""place"" could offer a cheap-ish cozy stay in a less touristy and more authentic part of town, yet close to a lot of shopping districts and the city nicest neighborhoods. It looks over a plaza buzzing with young locals drinking in bars. If you like minimal design, room is clean and bed is comfortable. But, as always, the human factor can break the deal. Ask the sleepy manager who took the brave decision to close the rooftop pool, saving the paying guests from certain death in the stormy waters up there (it was sunny...)

Lots of little streets to explore with a wide variety of bars and restaurants.The room was nicely finished in a contemporary, if slightly minimalist, style. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we both slept well. There were a few minor niggle points in that there was no fridge, iron, or tea making facilities within the room. In fairness, they were not listed within the amenities but we felt the room would have benefited from having them. The biggest problem for us was the sliding bathroom door.

Bread (which you could toast); cured meat; ham; cheese; shrink wrapped croissants and cakes; yogurt; limited fruit (oranges and bananas); orange juice; and tea and coffee. Sometimes there was less of a selection as the guy who was looking after breakfast most mornings didn't exactly rush to fill things up.

I have been to motels in thirds world countries that are painted better than this. There is about one advantage of staying at this place - the hotel is within walking distance of shopping centers, a few good restaurants, and public transportation. Now let me tell you everything that was wrong with this hotel during my stay in Roon 202:1. The sink would not drain properly. We brought our baby with us and it was incredibly tough to wash bottles in the sink when the water won't drain (pictures attached)2. The shower space has mold all over the place (pictures attached)3. No clock, safe or iron box/board available in the room4. Room is extremely small but rates are comparable to other better hotels 5. The hotel staff are all nice but tend to either give you bad information or information that contradicts other staff members (more on this later)6. There are two phones in the room, which makes no sense because the room is extremely small and doesn't need it7. Some hotel staff may tend to argue with you about the quality of the hotel (more on this later)8. The AC isn't as powerful as you'd expect it to be9. Being a Marriott gold member means absolutely nothing here10. Supposedly there are no upgrades for rooms at this hotel (more to come on this later)Every time I asked for a better room, I got one of 4 answers:1. There are no upgrades available right now2. All 36 rooms that this hotel has are exactly the same 3. All the ""superior"" rooms are taken (even though I was told that there are no room upgrades and that all rooms are built the same)4. Room 202 (the room I was in) is one of the best rooms in the hotel (which I find hard to believe)So I basically had to suck it up and live in hell for a week during my time in Barcelona. I did have one instance where I tried to explain to the staff about the condition of my room, and he had the nerve to argue with me. I was told that the rates were lower in this hotel, which is why they don't have things such as clocks/safes/iron boxes and boards. I was told that the AC works and that I need to give it time to cool the small room (I sometimes had to wait upwards of 2 hours). I was told that the sink was functioning even though it backed up constantly. I was told that my complaints would be relayed to the manager once he got back from vacation on Monday (still haven't heard anything from him).All in all, my best possible recommendation is for you to pay a little more and stay at a better hotel than to experience everything I did.

I'm not sure of the exact opening date but it can't be more than a year or so old. As a result, everything is very clean and everything works as expected. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We arrived a few hours early on our first day, and were allowed to check in slightly earlier than the advertised time, which was much appreciated after a long journey.The room itself was clean, with comfortable beds, a flatscreen TV, a table and a nice bathroom with a large walk in shower.One of the best parts of the room was the air-conditioning system. Going back to my previous statement that everything is fairly new and works as it should, this air conditioning was a godsend, especially in the high 20-low 30 degree heat of Barcelona in the middle of July. After a day of exploring, it was great to be able to come back to a nice chilled room before heading out again at night. The location of the hotel is fantastic. You are within 10 minutes of La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter, but the area the hotel is in (El Raval) is great for bars and restaurants too. The doors of the hotel open out on to Rambla del Raval, which is home to many bars, shops and places to eat. A short stroll along Career de l'Hospital will take you right on to La Rambla, whereas heading north toward Carrer del Carme and beyond will take you up towards the University and more great places to eat and drink.The hotel has its own restaurant and bar, as well as a downstairs club. As we were only in Barcelona for 4 nights with a relatively full itinerary, we didn't have a chance to sample it ourselves, but the food looked very nice, and we were never disturbed at night by noise from the nightclub. Another feature that we did not get the chance to use was the rooftop pool. Maybe next time...If you are planning a trip to Barcelona soon, I would recommend the Niu Barcelona.

As the city is so expensive I couldn't get a decent breakfast cheaper anywhere so I would suggest taking the breakfast in the hotel.The room itself was on the 4th floor right by the stairwell. The room was pretty small although the bathroom was a decent size. I asked for a double room but was given a room with two twin beds pushed together. This is not the same as the sheets are only single sheets so you end up just sleeping on one of the beds. There was no key to the safe which was annoying. The shower was pretty weak and the shower screen did not have a proper seal on the bottom so water flooded the bathroom after every shower with no drain in the floor to allow it to leave. The floors of the room and the corridors are tile so noises like people talking or the shutting of doors were heavily amplified. This, combined with a small bed with a lumpy mattress meant that I slept badly every night I was there which was a real shame.On the plus side, the room was cleaned every day and the general standard of cleanliness was good.

With no where else to go the night before our flight we had no choice but to book last minute accommodations at a hostel for the night.This trip was booked through our travel agent, and I reached out to her just in case she was unaware about this oddity. To my surprise, she emailed me back saying she had spoken to the front desk, and they confirmed checkout as noon! We spoke with the same front desk staff member from before, where he apologized for the mistake but offered nothing to help us other than a complimentary breakfast but only after we became insistent. We asked to speak to the manger who wasn't in to the next morning around 10 am.Speaking with the manger Anna had to be the most frustrating experience of my life. Though my ability to speak Spanish is limited, I understand it quite well. We explained the situation to her, but I could tell from her tone that she was going to be of little help. She refused to accept any responsibility and implied that it was our fault for not understanding 12 AM in Spain is different than 12 AM in Canada. Even the hostel confirmed that what they have printed on their check out card is incorrect! We received a temporary resolution provided by the hostel NOT the hotel. If they could sell the beds, they wouldn't charge us for the night. Anna told us she and the staff would continually check in with the hostel to see if it had been booked, but when we returned at 10 pm that day there was no update for us. The next morning, we had to check out. We asked the concierge if there was any new updates, but there was nothing. Only after we asked, did he call the hostel who confirmed that they would be charging us 64.00 EUR. We asked what is going to be done for us, and he offered nothing. We asked him to call Anna as she was not in, and she offered nothing. Arguments back and forth were clearly going no where. The poor staff member told us they would offer to pay for something else, I asked them to pay for the taxi to the airport as this would cost about 30 EUR, and instead they offered to pay for the train which cost 8.00 EUR. Pressed for time, we no choice but to call a taxi ourselves. We asked for the number of any supervisor we could speak to, but they refused to provide one for us.We were only in Barcelona for 3 days, but this definitely soured our experience and our mood, and because of that would not recommend this place or any of its chains to any friends/family in the future.",1,"First Time Visiting, Bad Experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d581779-r498714647-Hotel_Medium_Prisma-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,thomase7249

This time we stayed in the suite on the left of the main lounge (unfortunately the name escapes me) which is much better in configuration to the suite on the right so try and request that one. The only downside is you can hear the conversations of guests in the lounge next door and vice versa (which for us with 3 children was problematic trying to get our kids to speak quietly so as not to disturb the other guests eating and drinking in the lounge)!The location is excellent. Super convenient to La Rambla and the Cathedral. An awesome bonus is the proximity to Ciudad Condal - recommended by Gemma at the hotel and an excellent tapas restaurant just minutes away in the next block.

Then the Monday morning experience - my quick breakfast was interrupted no less than 5 times as the waiter wanted to make damn certain I had paid for it, which I explained I had... then at the end as I was leaving he was friendly! Then I went to check out and the guy on front desk asked for 23€ for my sushi. I explained I'd already paid directly to the delivery guy and instead of believing me like a normal human being he took the cash with a promise of reinstating it. I haven't mentioned the pre pay charge for a dog... if you travel with a dog they charge 200€ up front in case the dog damages the room. So €200 potentially for a dog, breakfast paid twice - which I just avoided- and sushi paid twice - it may look like a good price but an unaware tourist could be out of pocket for almost 250€!

We booked 6 rooms back in March around 11.30pm through a booking agency. We realised we had made a mistake within 10 hours of the booking so through the agency (who called the hotel direct at 9am) to try and cancel the rooms . They refused to do so stating they had a non cancellation policy . It was explained that as the holiday was not until September, surely they could take a small cancellation fee, but no they stuck to their policy rigidly . My friends & I worked something out so we could still use 4 out of 6 rooms . I called the hotel again requesting they cancel just 2 rooms . However again they refused to budge repeating like parrots their no cancellation policy . I think a bit of consideration & understanding would go along way . I only want to cancel 2 rooms which I'm sure they would be able to re sell before September!! Very unhappy customer who will not be recommending this hotel & the rest of it chain !

We booked a basic room just a few days before we stayed and found the price of £100 per night a good deal at such short notice. If you book a basic room and are surprised by the fact it is small and doesn't have a great view then you need to loosen the purse strings a bit! The basic room was cosy, very clean, had a fridge, big bathroom with rainforest shower, cleaning service every day if you want it and all the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The rooftop pool was small but very clean and there were enough loungers it seemed to stem the flow of people coming up at various points during the day, the view was good, pool temperature perfect for summer weather and clean toilets up there, including a shower and hairdryer for people who check out early but hang about the pool until their flight.If you're flying into El Prat then the Aerobus stops at Universitat, which is 3 minutes walk from the hotel.

I emailed ahead and asked for a nice room with a view as it was a surprise. I had booked transfers too.We arrived and there was no one waiting for us. We waited for half an hour but nothing. We walked 10 minutes through the terminals and we came across the transfer office. They did not apologise, just made a phone call and said 5 minutes. 15 minutes later still nothing. So I went back to the desk and they made another call and said 5 minutes. We were completely fed up by this time.We arrived at the hotel and the lady on reception told us to check in at 2 and took our bags and gave some information about catching buses etc. She was the only helpful person I came across. We collected our luggage and went to the room. Yes we had a sea view and the window opened wide which was nice ... and that is the only good thing I can say about this hotel. The room is in dire need of updating, walls are badly marked and when u pull back the curtain there was mould. The bed was hard and the only plug socket you could use was if you unplugged the lamp or fridge. Trying to get ready was a big issue as a woman. The hairdryer was in the bathroom but getting ready in there was impossible, no air con in bathroom, gets too hot to do makeup. So u have to pull the chair round to the long mirror, where there is nowhere to put makeup, I set myself up a table with my suitcase. Then had to unplug the fridge so I could use the socket for my own appliances.Housekeeping didn't clean our room any of the days of our stay until 430. Then all they did was make the bed and clean the shower. I went to have a shower on the second day and had no towels. I had told reception in the morning that my husband had broken a glass in the room which we had picked up the pieces and left on the tray. He told me not to worry as housekeeping would deal with it. They just left the glass on the tray, they didn't change our dirty coffee cups or replace any coffee or sugar etc. Very bad service and when I rang down reception just sent me 2 cups and a glass. I had to ask again for her to take the broken glass away. The breakfast was typical and nothing to really say about the quality. How this hotel makes any money is beyond me. My husband and I went to the bar at least 7 times during our stay looking for a drink and bite to eat. Only twice did we manage to get a drink as the bar was not staffed. We saw quite a few people walk away after being unable to get a drink. Absolute rubbish.The hotel was near the beach, which was nice. Just be warned the beach bars have very high prices. I was charged 9 euros for a pinacolada, picture was in a large glass, they brought it to the table in a plastic cup that was only half full, and when you cannot get a drink in your hotel you get forced elsewhere. Just take lots of euros with you. Would I go back ?

The good point is the location lots of restaurants within walking distance of all types/budgets , Metro station virtually outside the hotel but even as a base this hotel falls short of 4*.Small reception , tiny bar in corner of reception never saw it being used this is a shame because after a days sightseeing its nice to have somewhere to sit and relax , there was no atmosphere as its in the reception theres a small amount of chairs that need replacing as stained/tears etc . Most reception staff helpful , the younger girl on in an evening doesnt speak English or French so there was no way of communicating our problem to her so we gave up , a 24 hour reception needs staff fluent in more than one language. Everytime we passed reception she was on her mobile. Rooms were small with inefficient air conditioning , all buttons had been removed on the control panel to prevent people turning it up as the room was small it was very stuffy , there was no option of opening the windows as the traffic noise. The room needs updating , the beds were very hard and cheap quality and we were woken numerous times by doors banging loud noise inside the hotel and drilling on one occasion.I would expect tea/coffee making facilities in a 4*.Breakfast was a disgrace didnt even bother going on the last day. It is in the basement in a small stuffy airless room with no windows there are only 8 tables and no atmosphere. Were out of stock on breakfast tea for the whole 5 days no apologies (doesnt take much to pop to the supermarket 2 doors away ) Coffe machin useless everyone was complaining about it so slow there were large queues for drinks.

The travelagent offered a superior twin room which was also a roomtype on the website, it was combined with a flight. The price was about the same, so we booked trough tui. When we arrived at the hotel it was very clear that the room that was booked for us was not a superior room but a standard room. We tried to change this because we booked a superior room, but according to the manager he offered this room as a superior instead of the real roomtype because of the company were we have booked the room. This was unbelievable for us he just laughed at us and did nothing to help us with this problem he did not listen to our story but was only looking at the line with people who wanted to check out behind us. Because everything was full we had no other option to stay in the closet.The room is interior in a building, it looks like a closet and does not have enough space for two persons who stay 6 nights. There is a semi double bed, but this wasnt even close to the worst things. Every night we heard noises from the room next to us. There are a lot of young people in the hotel that like to go out every night. That's fine and fun but when they came home at 2:30, they kept talking loud and played music. If it wasnt for the room next to us we heared other noises like people leaving the pool area shouting and laughing hard, so hard it appeares that they were standing in our room. One night a fire alarm went off, we went to the reception and asked what was going on, he did not know. This was in the middle of the night. When we got back to sleep there was a constant noise like an alarm clock at 5:30 AM. I walked into the hallway and discoverd that the alarm went of because the room lock. When I went down to reception I again received the answer that they dit not know how to fix it. This morning I heard somebody snoring really loud, and no it wasnt my roommate.My other complaints are: The sheets of the bed were not replaced for six daysThe staff is nice except for the time when there are problems or complaints, they cannot handle or reslove them, the only answer is no or i cant do anything about it.The fire alarm went of in the middle of the night, there was no follow up on this, no excuse nothing.The only positive about this hotel is the nice location and great staff at the bar.",1,If you dont need any sleep stay here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d237160-r507337126-Hotel_Oasis-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Jett O

What a mistake we made. My partner and I are not picky, nor do we have unrealistic expectations for hotels - all we wanted was a clean, comfortable room. But, from the moment we opened the (broken) door to our ‘superior’ room, we were extremely disappointed…the balcony doors were also broken (so anyone from outside could get in)…the towels were dirty and the air-con was broken. Initially, we decided to put up with these issues, but the constant disruption from builders next door tipped us over the edge. From early in the morning to late afternoon, there were builders renovating the room directly next to us - we'd wake up to the sound of industrial drills and hammers, and the smell of dust and cigarettes. Obviously we were really disappointed, and requested to be moved. The manager laughed in our faces and dismissed our complaints, but promised to move us to a ‘better’ room. Later that day, we were directed to our new room - and I have never been more appalled. The smell of cigarette smoke was so pungent that my partner and I began to cough and react. Additionally the basic (ugly) wall fittings were falling apart, and there were stains all over the walls and lampshades. The lights didn’t work either. Sitting in a pitch-black room, knowing that the manager of Hotel Oasis was probably taking great pleasure in our misery, we asked to be moved again. This time, we were sent to an extremely basic (or ‘standard’) room that was just horrible, and definitely not what we paid for. So, we asked to be moved again. Finally, we were sent to a dingy, dark room with no exterior window. Throughout the moving process, we were constantly lied to about the availability of rooms. We were also told that our original room was now booked up - another lie! After admitting that our original room was actually still available, we moved back. Note: we moved back to a room NEXT TO a building site because every other room was WORSE. Throughout all of this, the manager never apologised or offered any kind of compensation, nor were the room/balcony doors fixed. The last straw came when a builder actually walked into our room one morning whilst we were sleeping - completely unacceptable! We mentioned this total disruption of privacy to the manager, who again laughed in our faces and tried to move us to another room. All we wanted was an apology, but no, we were belittled and ignored. This hotel is 2-stars for a reason, having a small rooftop terrace full of dirty outdoor furniture and overpriced drinks doesn’t make up for nasty rooms, broken facilities or disgraceful management. We heard several other guests complain about their rooms too, and they were told the same lies as us e.g. “there are no more rooms available”. Despite having a good location (even though the road noise is deafening on floor 1) and one nice receptionist, I would ward away all friends and family from Hotel Oasis. There are so many nicer hotels in the same neighbourhood, for the same price, where the manager won’t treat you like a piece of dirt. I have never been so appalled by a manager in my life - he alone ruined our experience. The building work may be completed by the time you’re looking at this hotel, but the sub-standard rooms and lying manager will remain.

Room had an air con, which was definitely needed. Only let down was breakfast. Service was great and breakfast was neatly presented, however the quality of ingredients was not that great which is a shame. Maybe we were spoiled by eating at one of the nearby bakeries two of the days, but I think that this is one area that can be improved upon.

There is also a safe in the room which is free if you ask for a key from reception.You get free tv and air conditioning thankfully as if you come in summer, you're pretty much guaranteed you'll need a mid afternoon break from the heat if you have a young family and they'll appreciate it too. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from the rambla which is one of the main shopping streets that leads to the harbour.Some advice... take water with you or shop on the side streets for it as in the centre you'll pay 1.50 euro a litre and on the other streets off it you'll pay maybe 35 to 50 cents for the same. The same goes for other stuff too.Fortunately there was a really cheap mini supermarket on the same block so it pays to look around. Turn left on the main street to the rambla and turn right and walk for 10 minutes to the fountains. They do a dancing fountains show at 930 Wednesday to Sunday but get there an hour early for a good view.Tip.. it pays to work 1 or 2 streets off the main road for shops and quirky little bars and places to eat.... there is so much to see. Also the mini bar (fridge) does great for little things like milk or butter or a bottle of water too.The hotel provides everything you need and the staff are great. It has its own restaurant but we didn't use it and chose to eat out. There is also a kiddies play area on the same block which is indoor ballpark type at 5 euro an hour.

We also stayed at the Petit Palace in Malaga and Madrid. The one in Barcelona is by far the WORST in terms of facilities (quite dirty) and personnel.The hotel is currently under renovation and there is dust around the reception area and other communal parts. The path to the lift is poorly lit also. Reception: the personnel is quite unfriendly, albeit polite. They distil relevant information slowly, including on how to access the hotel with your hotel card. Compared to the other two Petit Palace, they have a long way to go.Internet connection: simply embarrassing. Slow, choppy and unreliable. Breakfast: very expensive. Turn right and walk down one block. Then cross the street and keep walking down - On your left you will find ""El Fornet"" - High quality breakfast for a very reasonable price.We were also unlucky as the other guests were quite noisy and impolite.

We were not overly impressed and given the plethora of hotels in Barcelona we will probably stay elsewhere next time. We arrived about an hour prior to the official 2pm check-in. The person at the front desk sternly reminded us that we arrived prior to the check in time so we stored luggage and walked around. When we returned to check in the person at the front desk told us he could only give us one key due to ""system technical difficulties"" but that they will try to give us another key the following day. Given we were two people sharing a room with opposite schedules this didn't work for us and by evening time we got that second room key. The hotel is relatively modern. The rooms are spacious. The bathroom amenities are cheap and basic (more typical of a 2.5 star hotel in the US). The rain shower head didn't work so well so we used the shower hose which was a bit tricky to balance. Water also flowed all over the floor. Not a big deal just not overly convenient and comfortable. The wifi is slow and not overly reliable. There is a rooftop ""pool"". I would consider it more of an oversize bathtub. A few lounging chairs crammed together so overall not a very inviting area to enjoy the sun and bath. We didn't take advantage of any of the other facilities which weren't many aside from breakfast since the hotel doesn't have a gym. The hotel is located on Gran Via and next to a Metro station (the L1 line) which can get you to any part of Barcelona quickly. As mentioned above, most likely will not choose to return to this hotel.

To start off, you walk into the lobby and everything is very dark. The furniture, the walls, and a lot of the decorations were either black or very dark which is not appealing for a hotel. It gave a sort of muggy look and scary really. The hotel rooms had a lot of issues such as doors not locking securely, tvs not working, and leaking from vents. The maid service was also unacceptable. After being out all day, we stopped by our hotel room around 5pm and the room was still not done. After calling the front desk they mentioned the maids were gone for the day and the best thing they could do was give us fresh towels. Just towels? I thought that was unacceptable. Overall although the Petit Palace Barcelona has a good location it does not compensate for the lack of service given to its guests.Only Pros: About a 10min walk to las Ramblas and main shopping/dining area.

It is clean and the towels, cosmetics etc. changed daily. The hotel situated at the intersection of the streets: carrer de Viladomat, carrer de Valencia and carrer d’Arago – in a calm middle-class area. The noise from the construction work across the hotel front was felt just one morning for 6 days, spent at the hotel. The closest metro is at 350 m, called Roca fort, exit Cambria (the station has 2 exits). On one hand, the hotel is not far away from the downtown, boutiques and department stores, and tourist attractions. On the other hand, 1.5-2 km in the humid and hot Barcelona… Nevertheless, such a position beyond the tourist area has an advantage. You may eat better and cheaper.The very good seafood restaurant, called the Crown Marine, is located at the intersection of carrer d’Arago and carrer Rocafort (Esquina Carrer d'Arangó, Carrer de Rocafort, 130, 08015 Barcelona). Normally it is not cheap. But, the menu served from 1.30 pm to 4 pm is only euro 12. The dishes of the menu are changed every day, and they are all delicious. Because of the local clients, it is almost impossible to find a table up to 3 pm. Later it is quite possible. The trip from the airport to the hotel is possible by taxi, subway (metro) or express bus. The bus stop is 15 m off the exit from the main terminal of the airport (baggage claim of arrival area), on your right. The bus is called AEROBUS. The cost is euro 5.90. This express bus makes just 3 stops (placa Espanya, carrer del Comte d’Urguell, and placa de Catalunya). It takes 20 minutes from the airport to the city center. Our stop is Urguell (pronounced “urhel”). The Barcelona’s central bus station (if you wanna go, for example, to Tarragona or Valencia) can be reached by the direct subway line from your ‘hotel metro station’.Our room 603 was quite good, a corner one with views on Viladomat and Arago/Valencia streets.The grocery stores are El Corte Ingles, CONSUM, Mercadona, and DIA. All are close, not more than 500 m off. El Corte Ingles is little more expensive, but the best.There is no fan (exhauster) in the bathroom, the mirrors become misty over.

The room was nicely decorated, immaculate with a super King bed, seating area, X2 satalite tv. Bathroom was spacious,with separate wc and separate walk in shower. Unfortunately we did not eat at the hotel as we wanted to see as much of Barcelona as we could in the 3 day visit. Hotel was situated in the residential area which suited us as the city centre was very busy and noisy. Close to Clot metro station approx 5 min walk and 15 minute walk to Sangradia Familial Basilica which is a must see. Lovely street of cafe bars near the basilica. Used the tour bus for 1 day which made it easier to see the city, only wished we had booked a 2 day pass as there was so much to see. Would definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully will return soon to complete the tour of this lovely but very busy city.

We had a professional conference at the convention center which is next to the AC Hotel Barcelona Forum- Easy walking distance to the metro. The Metro (underground subway) is very easy to navigate, very clean, air conditioned and staff are available to assist if you need help. Passengers are also a great source for help - the people of Barcelona are so helpful. Buy a multiday pass at the Barcelona airport or at the metro station.- Rooms are clean, clean, clean. The hotel staff are friendly and incredibly efficient. We appreciate the staff for their pride in keeping the rooms cleaned.- At the end of a long or hot day, take a quick dip in the pool. There are poolside loungers, tables and more tables inside the restaurant. The hotel can provide pool towels and the staff are very attentive. Enjoy a drink poolside - the view is absolutely beautiful!!- Across the street is the Diagonal Mall - lots of shopping, food choices and good restaurants (asian, italian, spanish...). We enjoyed an evening of tapas and paella which were very tasty and reasonably priced. A grocery story is located inside the Diagonal Mall - get some bread, wine, cheese, a bit of prosciutto and fruit for your hotel room! The selection at the grocery store is amazing and you won't be disappointed.- The hotel has a very good breakfast area with a wide selection of food. The service was incredible and the staff worked very hard to keep the food fresh and the tables clean. - The hotel room was very clean and kept clean every day. The beds were comfortable, the air conditioning functioned perfectly and the rooms had darkening shades. For an international traveler, these provided the right environment for a great night of sleep. - Beyond the obvious sights of Barcelona that are listed in Tripadvisor, don't miss the many unlisted churches (the architecture and relics are historical gems that cannot be found elsewhere, one church had a special staircase that led us to the most amazing rooftop views of Barcelona), a simple scoop of gelato by the waterfront, and the wonderful food/wines from the local restaurants.- From the hotel, it is a relaxing 10-15 minute walk to the beach. There were a lot of families, surfers, people playing sports, open showers and a few nude bathers. The beach area was well maintained and busy on a hot day.- Taxis can be found in front of the hotel. Very convenient. - And, most importantly, I have to mention the high level of service provided by the hotel staff at the AC Hotel Barcelona Forum. Near the end of our trip, the glass vanity in our bathroom became cracked. We informed the front desk staff immediately and returned from our city visit in the afternoon to find that the entire glass vanity in the bathroom was replaced (wow!). Front desk, housecleaning, restaurant, poolside - we received the best service from this team and truly appreciate how comfortable our stay was because of their efforts.Barcelona and its culture are worth exploring.

The toilet door lock was broken, the place was filthy inside and out with used glasses and food debris everywhere and children were just helping themselves with no supervision which surprised me as technically these children had unsupervised access to alcohol, I thought this level was over 18s !!  There was little or no food available at the key walk in times like 7pm, this was repeated in the afternoon. This is the 7th year staying at this hotel and the executive lounge facility was the reason I booked the hotel, but over the last couple of years it seems to have gone downhill and has got progressively worse. I thought last year's poor service was a one off but it was poor for the two days I stayed there this year.  It is the last time I would consider upgrading for the executive lounge in future and may actually not book there at all next year.

The worst evidence of the complete lack of focus on the customer was that despite reporting a faulty lock which allowed us to have interconnecting rooms with our children this was not fixed and we spent an uncomfortable night listening out to ensure they were ok.

From the outside the hotel is attached to another unfinished building and it looks like construction has been abandoned... it's not a great look especially with all the tagging on the building. Having said that the inside of the functioning part is well kept and around 4 star level. There's not a whole lot going on in the area, it's about 30 mins by underground from the centre of Barcelona, but you are 10 mins walk to the beach in that area. Also the poble nou area is quite close (catch the tram outside the hotel doors) and is good for meals. We hired bikes and found it the best way to get into town. It's an area for music festivals in the forum area and conferences so may be higher prices at certain times. However it's much calmer and quieter than staying near la rambla or catalunya especially at peak times.There's a large mall across the road and some of the restaurants are quite good, we had great pinxtos at Sagardi. But had most meals in the town centre. There's a gigantic supermarket in the mall with all you need including a large alcohol selection.The staff were very helpful but it did take quite a long time to check in. The pool is upstairs on the roof and is quite small area so often no stretchers available but nice to cool off in pool after walking in sun all day. Also gets a bit windy. There's a pool bar but I never saw anyone serving there.The room was clean and nice with good pillows. It was smaller than expected especially for three adult people. There were a million light switches, some labelled, some not, so we had a fun game trying to turn them all off at night!The bathroom has a see through blind which means people in the bedroom can see you getting undressed, good for honeymooners but not so much when staying with friends or parents!! We booked one room for three but it appeared they just put campbed in the room. No extra towel, mug, wine glass etc so obviously they assumed a small child. There was a kettle and tea/coffee which was great and unusual in Barcelona. Also it appeared on the website the extra bed would be in a separate area but not so. Breakfast was 16 Euro but was high quality and plentiful with mumms champagne, a range of good quality meats and cheeses, hot food etc. The museum of natural history across the road is worth the visit although almost completely empty as most visitors to Barcelona come for the beach!",3,Nice hotel away from hustle and bustle of city ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1223953-r505408385-Hotel_SB_Diagonal_Zero_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Stiffler08

Another issue is breakfast is served in the sister hotel across the road. Don't forget to pick up a pass on your way out. I wouldn't vouch for their breakfast, not the best.

But where to park if the street is permanently occupied by cars. And we could not park in the hotel yard as it is too small for two cars.

One month prior to my arrival I confirmed that they had received my payment but the credit card i used had to cancel due to some fraudulent charges. I confirmed with Hector that I would be bringing a different credit card but I would have my passport and that we would be arriving at midnight and I did not want to have any sort of hassle. He assured me it would be fine after checking with management. Once we tried to check in I went through a huge hassle all regarding this same issue. Finally that was resolved and the person took us to our rooms and the first door he opened there was a couple in bed prepared to make love. How horrifying! He then check us into our other two rooms and showed us how the air conditioning work. Lo and behold the next day we are trying to take a nap and my son came in and said his room was so hot. I couldn't get it to work and so I went to management, he came down and showed us that the air conditioning that we had been shown for this room wasn't operative and that there was a remote control for another one. I felt horrible that my son and friend sweltered through the night and the day. He did comp us some Waters. The locations lovely but the rooms are small. One other thing is that they only have European Outlets. Unfortunately I did not see the little folded card that said that adapters are available for $7 and I had waited a day and went to the local mall to buy two adapters for $22. I think the customer service aspect and training needs to be re-evaluated. Management did tell me that they had three new employees. One other thing is that we couldn't get our safes to work. These are very important to us as we wanted to store our passports. My husband went down the first morning and asked the attendant about the safes and she said none of them were operational in the entire Hotel .

They expect to serve you well, and they expect that they will be good at it.I don't always like dining in the hotel, but you should for this hotel. The views of Barcelona make up for the lack of proximity to most of the Barcelona attractions. That's because the hotel is nestled atop Mt Tibidabo. It overlooks Barcelona. That means you trade easy access to Barcelona hot spots for the view and some privacy.We particularly enjoyed the view over breakfast - an opulent affair spanning all the spreads: from cuts of artisanal sausage to custom made omelettes to racks of sweet buns and breakfast meats galore. I particularly enjoyed having a drink and looking at La Sagrada Familia - still imposing from a distance.The rooms themselves are very large and very comfortable. I've stayed in Parisian hotel rooms as large as the bathroom in our room in Gran Hotel La Florida. The turndown service even sets the system to play classical tunes as one gets ready for bed. Our room featured a balcony from which I could check out Sagrat Cor (itself worth a short walk).There are so many wonderful places in the world to see.

We purchased a 'Barcelona card' which allowed us use of the cities excellent public transport system, all of which is readily accessible from this central hotel.We requested a double bed in advance through the booking.com app, received a room with 2 singles, frustrating but not the end of the world. The room itself was an ok size for 2 people but felt very small due to the window not allowing much light in. After exploring Barcelona all day, my wife and I decided to spend a little time on the rooftop soaking up the sun in the jacuzzis before our concert that evening. We were disappointed to read upon arrival that the jacuzzis were in fact hydrotherapy pools (unheated), again frustrating but it's summertime so not the end of the world.We had bought a couple of beers and took them up to the roof and hadn't sat down for more than 30 seconds before being set upon by a very rude member of staff who asked us to leave immediately as we were not aloud to bring our own drinks to the rooftop. I attempted to reason with her, explaining that it was one bottle of beer, we were unaware of this rule as there are no signs or notices anywhere we had seen forbidding bringing your own drinks, plus it was our first visit to the hotel and city - all to no avail. We offered to pour out the drinks and buy some from the bar, no. Out.

Then we went to open the cupboard door so we could check the mini fridge. The door was literally hanging off it's hinges. Every time we closed the cupboard after using the fridge, we had to pop the door back in place.Additionally, the washroom (the bathtub especially) had mold/mildew in the corners. The cleaning lady only changed the towels; she didn't even try to clean the mold.And the WiFi. From our room on the third floor, the wifi was incredibly slow. From time to time it would disconnect for no apparent reason. This was really annoying when we were trying to check our emails, read the news etc.Lastly, the Jacuzzis on the roof were lame.

Despite booking a double room, when we entered into our room following check in it was apparent that we had been given a twin room. Nothing was said to us about this at check in, so we had to head back down to the reception desk to ask to be moved to a double room as per our booking. The receptionist was very rude, didn't apologise, said that there was nothing he could do about it (he couldn't move us, he couldn't arrange for the the bed to be made into a double bed ) and smugly stated that the hotel being able to unilaterally change the type of room a guest had booked was (apparently) ""within the terms and conditions"". We asked if there was anything else he could do - for example, give us a complimentary breakfast the next day - but we were firmly told that he couldn't do a single thing (including, as it became only too apparent, apologise). We asked to speak to the manager, but the manager wasn't at the hotel until the next day (which is worrying in and of itself - surely a duty manager should be at the hotel at all times?!). We asked for the manager to contact us the next morning - but we heard nothing. On check out, I asked for a feedback form and described our issue so as to give the hotel a chance to apologise and make amends (I always like to give service providers a chance to correct issues before taking to Tripadvisor to write a scathing review) - but still nothing. I'm sorry, therefore, to post this review - but it's only fair that other travellers are aware of our experience. If you book a specific room here, beware - you may get any old room depending on how the hotel feels on the day! Otherwise, our room was OK and it was clean - but generally the hotel is pretty mediocre and tired. And the service is utterly horrendous.",1,"Tired hotel, awful service - but good location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d596508-r508948789-Barcelona_Center_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,pinksiobhan017

My only wish was that there were viewing points along the roadway so that you could take photos. The total tolls I paid were €29.10 (€3.70 + €3.70 + €21.70). Finding IBIS Barcelona Meridiana was not entirely difficult, even with my bicycle oriented GPS map of Spain. Although the hotel is located outside the center of Barcelona, I found the location to be ideal, especially with the amount of visitors/vacationers that I encountered in the city. It is located specifically in Heron City and part of/connected to a mall, that includes a supermarket, and next to a Cortés Inglés (is a 'national' department store). The mall includes a few decent places to eat (and has a McDonalds, if you are so inclined). There is also a nice park directly across the street that contains a large public swimming pool. And, of course, there is also an adjacent residential area to explore, listen to the linguistic cadence of the people and find typical tapas bars.Although, IBIS Barcelona Meridiana is located outside of the center, the metro station 'Favra i Puig' on Line 1 is located a 15 minute leisurely walk from the hotel (out the front door, to the right, through the park). The cost of a one-way 'simple ticket' or 'billete sencillez' is €2.15. I would recommend taking Line 1 from Favra i Puig to the Catalunya stop -- a 15 minute ride. This will put you in the center of much of the ""action"" and a good point to access much of the city center. This is where I took the 'Hop On Hop Off' sight-seeing tour bus, which I highly recommend. I initially thought the €29 price was expensive. However, it turned out to be more than fair, as Barcelona is a grand city. There are two routes to the tour: one on the 'blue line' and one on the 'red line' -- each taking approximately 2 hours to complete without getting off. This is a very good way to see Barcelona. But, if you really want to EXPERIENCE Barcelona, you need to consider staying several days.(A couple of other comments about the city of Barcelona. There are 1.1M inhabitants in the city of Barcelona. But, if you include the outer areas of the city, Barcelona has 3M inhabitants. Also, Barcelona is very bike and moto friendly. Alongside most of the city roadways, there are separated and separate routes/lanes for both bikes and motos. The suggestion is there are over 100 km or 65.5 miles of these lanes!)In between the two tour lines, I actually had lunch in the cafeteria on the 9th floor of Cortés Inglés. There are window tables that line the entire length of the 9th floor. Shall, I say the view of the city is SPECTACULAR! If you can grab a window seat. If you can't but can sit even somewhat close, you will be very pleased nonetheless. Even though the dining location is listed as a 'cafeteria', all the food looks gourmet. And, I can testify that it is. I had the seafood paella (there were 3 types of paella, including a vegetarian option), which was incredible!... The portion was significant and I only paid €9.95. I would have paid €19.95!I know this review is supposed to be about IBIS Barcelona Meridiana. But, it is really about the entire experience. The hotel is a typical IBIS (the 3rd I have stayed in on my vacation and the best next to IBIS Málaga Centro) -- the main space and bathrooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. The staff were very nice, engaging and attentive -- much more so than in the other IBIS locations I have been in. Perhaps, this is because Barcelona has greater competition for hotel rooms and the staff are ""more on their game"". There is parking under the Heron City Mall, which is a nice option. But, I think the cost, which is €12.80, is a little high, especially since I am currently paying €8.00 at IBIS Madrid Meridiana. At minimum, where IBIS does charge for parking, perhaps they should be consistent at €8.00. All other IBIS accommodations are fairly constant, why not the price of parking where they charge for it?Still, and all-in-all, I would highly recommend planning your stay at IBIS Barcelona Meridiana.",5,IBIS Barcelona Meridiana--More Than Worth The Visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d231518-r506219396-Ibis_Barcelona_Meridiana-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Jimmie W

For a few days we could manage, but if we had stayed here for e.g. a week this would not have been feasable.The hotel staff could easily smell this themselves and should immediately have offered another room (if the problem was room-located).Breakfast: ok, enough choice.

I found this quite shocking again for the rating and price. Regardless, even with the fan turned at maximum and the temperature at minimum, the room temperature was still way too warm, On maximum the fan was too weak to adequately cool the room. In addition (again, quite surprising) is that when you remove the room key that powers the lights, the air conditioning shuts off as well. At the end of the summer day, when you come in all hot and sweaty from touring around, the room temperature was unbearable and took hours to ""cool"".Housekeeping staff was not quite competent. Three times during 7 day stay I had to call the front desk because either the soap was not replaced, the shampoo or conditioner was not replaced, my bathrobe was not replaced etc. Again, this should NOT happen at a hotel that supposedly is rated this highly.For the final straw, my room safe was broken.

But nights 2 & 3 the room was not cleaned properly, mini-bar not replaced, toiletries not replaced, all round a shoddy/rushed job (not once but twice). After we complained to Front Desk things were fine - but the staff on Housekeeping those two days badly let the hotel down - just simple laziness.The second problem is that Wi-Fi, whilst free throughout, is not stable at all and not only keeps dropping, but can remain down for long periods of time. If you do find that you are the type of person that needs to work whilst travelling, this can be a major interruption.But solve the 2 problems above and you have a very good, pleasant experience and even without a Gym or Pool, you would have a good stay if only those 2 issues could be resolved.",4,Great Location and Great Front Desk Staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d285755-r501768583-Vincci_Maritimo_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,AdrianShanghai

We were planning to have lunch at the pool and did a bit of sunbathing. We collected the towels from the lady at the pool counter, and we sat down at two empty sunbeds, spent a few minutes to undress and settle down our things there. Then the lady came to us and said ""Sorry, if you would like to stay on these sunbeds, you would have to pay."" She showed us a menu as follow:€20 for using one sunbed€30 for using one sunbed + one drink€40 for using one sunbed + one drink + one burger""... or if you prefer not to pay, you can move to the beanbags area on the floor, and that is free."" She said. Oh well... We certainly were ""cheapskates"" and we decided to roll over to the floor without spending a cent. We didn't even want to buy our lunch as planned. We discussed, and decided that we would never spend a further cent at this hotel, and would never come back again. I have been travelling around the world and this was the first time I felt shocked and humiliated at a hotel pool. As a beachside resort hotel, Occidental Atenea Mar Hotel failed to provide the most basic facility – sunbeds!!! How about the couches in the lobby? Shall they impose some charges as well? I didn't dare to sit there if it costed €20... There were plenty of space at the pool area. They could simply put more sunbeds there instead of having so much empty space on floor. If this is not a strategy to rip off clients, I don't see any justification for this tier of charges otherwise. Even if this is the hotel's deliberate business decision to impose such a ridiculous tier of charges for basic facilities, there could be a more civilised and human way of managing client's expectation. For example, the pool lady could have explained the tier of charges when we picked up the towel, and she could have put some warning signs on the two empty sunbeds. But she didn't!!! No sign, no explanation. She gave us the towels without a word, and waited for a few minutes for us to settle down, and then she came! If this is not designed to be a duo-way trap for ripping off clients or humiliation, then it must be a duo-way mess of brainless hotel management and reckless staff implementation.我一直在世界各地旅行，這是我第一次在酒店游泳池感到震驚和羞辱。作為一家海濱度假酒店，Occidental Atenea Mar Hotel酒店未能提供最基本的設施 - 日光浴床！大堂的沙發怎麼樣？他們也要強加一些費用嗎？我會真誠地建議任何值得基本的尊重的旅客，以避免這家酒店，無論你有20歐元浪費在日光浴床上。",1,What a humiliating experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d291590-r508642096-Occidental_Atenea_Mar_Adults_only-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,wongy911

Great security in the hotel, cant use the lifts without your room card. Room - We had 1 room for 4 of us, its perfect and 10/10 for the cleanliness! Could not fault the room, small kitchenette if you need it, two tvs in the room, the sofa converted into a double bed (wasn't the most comfortable) but the main bed is. I would ask for more pillows though! The pillows are thin! Room cleaning was done daily, and done really well! No complaints from me! Lovely big bath and shower. Pool area - The pool is small yes, (you can see that from the photos) I can see that in winter it would be FREEZING as in summer it was still cold but it was hot so it was refreshing, I think a few more sun loungers would be beneficial and the towels restocking would be ideal. My children loved the pool. Location - Good location, close to shops, Metro (buy a t10 pass, which allows 10 rides) *The café across the road -BEAM is great for breakfast, pancakes are amazing as is the musli and yoghurt!",4,Good choice in Barcelona!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2278972-r507432974-Ako_Suite_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,kazz_usher

Overall the we stayed in was spacious and clean with plenty of wardrobe space.Our room was back of the hotel, which meant it was nice and quiet. However the windows looked out into an external shaft so had no view and little sunlight.The lighting in the room itself was a little dim but I guess it could be classed as subdued, and there is no fridge, iron or kettle in the rooms. There is a safe, hair dryer and tv and good wifi. On each floor there is a small fridge with small bottles of water and in the lobby there are 2 computers with a printer to be able print out tickets etc..Breakfast at the hotel is continental style with sausages,bacon and scrambled egg, costs 12 Euro (there are lots of coffee shops and cafes less than 5 min walk from the hotel).The area is about a 15min walk to the Diagonale or Gracia metro stations. However this is a much more relaxed part of Barcelona. Nice bars and restaurants only a short walk. The Meatpacking Bistro around the corner is really nice. Over the road there is a big food supermarket.Taxi from the airport was around 35 Euro.I would definitely recommend the hotel if you don't want to be in the very hustle and bustle part of Barcelona and don't mind a 15min amble to the nearest metro stop or hop-on-hop-off bus stop.

My experience at reception was great, the lady was very helpful and took the time to explain the best things to do in Barcelona, which I found very useful.

I didn't regret it as the room was large with 4 separate sections, a big spa style bath, two TVs, king size bed and most importantly a nespresso machine. The only thing missing was a balcony. Being on the ninth floor it was very handy to the 10th floor pool. The view from the pool is stunning and goes right around so you can see sagrada familia in the distance. I enjoyed sunbathing and reading my book there, the pool was quite small however.

The hotel is modern with a coral and the sea theme running throughout in furnishings etc. The style is attractive and quirky. Upon entering, reception is also in the communal area which is where breakfast is also served. I found reception to be friendly and very accommodating. We arrived very late and were assigned a ground floor room which I was told could not be changed that night. Unfortunately we slept very badly due to pavement noise and dustbin lorries etc. Asked at reception early the next morning and were given a 3rd floor room facing away from roads etc. RoomsThe room was comfortable with a large bed complete with a very thick mattress topper so sleep was excellent. The room was fairly basic but modern with all that you need, good power shower, air con. etc. BreakfastBreakfast was very busy but we chose to sit in the outside courtyard with sofas tables and was cool and quiet. Food was fairly standard with a nod to Spain with tasty Spanish tortilla and also tomato pulp to spread on your toast. Bikes We hired two bikes at a cost of €15 per bike per day and a €50 refundable deposit from the hotel. It was a great way to pedal the cycle lanes along the coast and through the quieter parts of the city. Area The area is away from the city but fairly near (10 mins) walk to the hive of activity which is the beach. Great for cycling and walking for many miles before breakfast. The city is also easily reached by foot through the Parc de citadella to the Gothic quarter and beyond. Would we stay here again? Yes in the summer because of its position to the sea.

When we arrived, their handicapped-accessible room on the ground floor, Pisa 0, was awaiting, and by that time I was so fully aware of my travel limitations, that I never even enquired about the ""regular"" room. I was so glad, The accessible room was great, a bit dark perhaps, but it had a small patio where we could sit with coffee and look up at the apartments of Barcelonans VERY near above our heads. The room was very quiet, but there is absolutely no ""view."" This is a 3-star, not a truly full service hotel, one isn't supposed to take breakfast to the room and then leave dirty dishes outside the door awaiting pick-up, for instance. But when I did commit this faux pas the first morning, the woman who ran breakfast explained the policy (in Spanish), but then let me do it anyway. I never did it again, but her attitude bespoke my experience of that of the entire staff: they felt they were there to serve us. I did use the laundry service, which was expensive but excellent, and I'm particular. Almost everyone spoke English much better than I do Spanish, so they seemed to prefer communicating in my language, rather than listening to me butcher theirs.",5,"Lovely staff, wonderful location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1207602-r500346588-Hotel_Denit_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Parkview3SW

A wonderful department store a half block away was perfect for finding toiletries, gourmet food, and gifts. A top notch vegetarian restaurant is just a short walk away. The hotel staff members are kind and accomodating.Now, the stuff that may rankle over time. The breakfast gets monotonous (we supplemented with purchased items). The street is narrow and very echoey, and Barca street life is lively, so unless you can live with artificially chilled air, sleep will be disturbed. The sheets and towels are over-bleached! This hurt my skin, and even though the very helpful senyora allowed me to select sheets by feel and smell one day when I mentioned this, the next day it was back to the same.

My teenage daughter and I had a basic twin room on the 2nd floor. I asked for a quiet room (i.e. away from the bar and rooftop pool) and away from the lift, which I was given. As in any city-based hotel, earplugs were useful. The cleaners arrived early and were noisy than the norm. The pool is on the 8th floor. It's superb! After sightseeing it was a quiet, sunny haven to get a cocktail and some chill. It got a little busy at times but there was always a seat available, even if there weren't any loungers left. My only criticism is that smoking is allowed which seems a bit dated in an area where there's drink/food/children. Perhaps smoking should just be around the bar and not the pool. The room/bathroom itself were a little weary but the shower was powerful; pillows comfy; bed was clean, so all good! The staff were all lovely and helpful, particularly the bar/waiting staff on the ground floor. It's a 10/12 min walk to the beaches, which again, were superb. La Rambla and Casa Bastilo would be a bit too much to walk (I think!) so we hopped in a taxi -there are taxis to the left of the hotel- and then walked back. €10 ish.

I don't understand the prices we pay compared to the quality of the experience, it speciallymakes me wonder who works there and if they can be trusted, as they do not have respect for the comfort of guests. The sheets had little wholes in many places. The floor was scratched a lot. I sensed a really bad smell in the halls. One of the receptionists was cranky and moody when people requested things that don't match what he wants, but are normal people's requests. I sense some entitlement here, that needs them to be reminded of who's paying, I mean, if they ask for so much money, they should care about people and listening to them.

The bathroom was sizeable and had a jacuzzi bath (which we didn't use). No locks on the door though which may bother some people. The rooms had blackout curtains and the control for the air con was right by the bed and it worked really well. The wifi in the room worked but wasn't the best and we didn't use the tv although it was a big flat screen LG. The rooms were really clean and cleaned everyday to a good standard. Other reviews I read prior to going said you could hear noise from other rooms but we only heard doors slam once our entire stay. The reception staff were helpful and spoke good English, they gave us a city map and recommended the best metro ticket to buy as well as letting us keep our bags there until we needed to leave. Hospital clinic metro was about a 10minute walk and they gave us good directions. The negatives I am going to write about are a bit picky and don't have anything to do with the room- The hotel's restaurant isn't actually a restaurant it's a 'gourmet bar' so when we were tired from a day's exploring and hungry during the hours restaurants were shut (16.00-20.00) we couldn't have a meal because there weren't really meals on offer. The room service food looked better but we didn't use it as it was quite expensive. We used the spa on our last day as we had a late flight and check out was 12pm. It cost €15 each and you had to buy a swim cap for €3 to use it for 'hygiene reasons' even though they don't keep your hair from getting wet. When we got in it was really small, the jacuzzi is built into the pool (which is small) and it takes ages to charge in between bubbles if that makes sense. There was a small sauna and Turkish bath as well as showers and a jet shower, 3 heated sun loungers and another 3 normal sun loungers. This is not adequate for the size of the hotel at all- there were only 3 other people in there with us and it would have been crowded if there were many more. To make matters worse, three workmen came in while we were using the spa and tried to fix the shower jet by the pool. They had crowbars and drills with sparks flying everywhere which was dangerous and noisy and smelled awful. We made a swift exit and the lady in the spa reception asked if we were ok and I said not really and she replied 'but they're going now' No offer of a refund or anything else. That was a bit of a sour end to an otherwise lovely stay.",4,"Excellent room, avoid the spa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d229680-r507012641-Melia_Barcelona_Sarria-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Nicole P

Entry to the hotel was clean (smells of lemons) Every member of staff, from reception to bar staff were pleasant, professional, multilingual and helpful. Hotel is quirky, lots of artwork and would appeal to many. It's about a 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas. Hotel also hire out bicycles, I believe for free for guests. I didn't go into the gymMy partner booked us a standard room and we were put into room 508. There was an ice bucket with a small bottle of cava there, which was a nice touchThe itself was quite small facing a busy road, but the glazed windows seem to block out most of the traffic noise. The room had everything we needed, Wi-Fi, TV (not many British channels), kettle with tea and coffee, bathrobes and slippers, Minibar and safe. It didn't have any drawers so we are limited with space for underwear etc. The bathroom had everything we needed including hairdryer and they also supplied the usual shampoos/gels. The only negative criticism is that both carpets in the hallway and bedroom were looking very tired and the paintwork in the bathroom was pretty bad and needed attention and not what you would have expected in a 4* hotel. On our last night at 2 AM the air-conditioning failed and started leaking. We had to switch it off as the water was coming from the ceiling and my partner wasn't sure whether this was anywhere near electrics. We reported it in the morning and Tamara who was working on reception that morning (excellent member of staff) dealt with the problem immediately. She upgraded us to a superior room room 706. We happened to be leaving to come home the next day and they allowed us to stay until 6 PM as a goodwill gesture which was great which allowed us to leave our stuff there and not worry about checking out at middayTo be honest, the superior room, as big as it was, including a larger television, location wise, I preferred the standard room. Room 706 was far more noisy. It was on the corner with great views and more windows but you could hear so much more traffic. Don't know the price difference between the two and I do appreciate the upgrade which was free but if you are looking for an upgrade, perhaps ask for a quiet side of the hotelTerrace - can't really sunbathe out there. Not many beds and too much noise as there is construction with a nearby hotel or office block being built. There is a small plunge/dipping pool which might fit four or five people in there. Bar is good with nice seating area, quiet on a Sunday ! There is a local shop a stones throw from the hotel (walk out of the hotel, turn left and you are there) if you are purchasing milk or any other goods, make sure he puts them through the cash register as we were ripped off - there is a Lidl not too far away as wellTaxis from airport - we paid €28 plus a further nine euros on top, not sure what that was for but it was late when we arrived. It took about 20 minutes to get to the hotel. On our way back, there was a taxi strike. We walked to the train station which is approximately 15 minutes walk. It cost €8.40 for two tickets to get to the airport and took about 15 minutes to get there and it was a direct route. Trains and metros are spotlessIt's a nice hotel, the staff is the only reason I'm giving it a four star rating.

It had 2 bedrooms (1 with queen bed, 1 with twin beds) and a pull out couch in the living room. Our room was top floor (5 I believe) and had an obstructed view of the Sagrada Familia - but a view nonetheless! Loved our view and having drinks on the patio.The staff was not very warm. We never once were greeted with a smile or offered assistance proactively, though to be fair they were happy to help when asked. We travel A LOT - so really appreciate courteous front desk staff.The 4th day (of 5 days) we decided to do laundry, only to find out the washing machine was broken. Wouldn't have been the end of the world if the machine hadn't partially filled up with water - so at 8 pm we had to insist that they find another place to wash our clothes since we couldn't pack wet clothes! It was a bit of a drama, and the lady at the front desk helped, but it was a less than ideal way to end our week.Overall I would still recommend this place - had the washing machine been functioning properly we could have lived with the rest of it. The location is fab - walking distance to many little grocery stores, more authentic restaurants, and of course the Sagrada Familia!

Most important to us is service and the staff here is exceptional. Though small, they really look after every detail and make sure you are comfortable and secure. The staff is very helpful from helping book excursions to tips on the best places to eat, shop and when to do what. I believe there are only 30 rooms at this hotel. We had a 3rd floor room with a small balcony overlooking La Ramblas. The room was probably entry level, thus very small, but we have been in smaller. You can hear the Metro below the hotel for the lower floor rooms. We heard it on the 3rd floor, but it was honestly not a bother and never disturbed our sleep - maybe because we were so exhausted every evening. The 6th floor rooms are the jacuzzi suites. The roof top bar is very quiet, as it is primarily hotel guest. The pool is really just to sit around and soak your feet while having cocktails. Nice place for a drink before you head out for the evening.The hotel location is very secure with many police patrolling the area. You are in the center of La Ramblas and in the heart of the Gothic quarter, so everything is at your finger tips from shops to restaurants to the La Boqueria market, which is almost next door. You are also a very short walk from the Metro, which proves invaluable for visits to Sagrada Família and Park Güell.Our recommendation for your visit would be to dig deep into the Gothic quarter for restaurants and shops, not the ones right on La Ramblas. They are so much more intimate and really help you enjoy the culture. Also, if you want to eat close to the hotel, go behind the catholic church just next door and there is a square there with great restaurants and really nice atmosphere. So close and mostly locals. We had dinner and drinks at Bar Lobo. We also really enjoyed the tranquility of Gats after a crazy long walking day. It was nice to find peace and great eats so close to our hotel. Both of these places are in this square.Important tips:If you have Verizon - the $10/day travel plan is awesome - no data/call/text limitsCall your credit and debit card companies before travelling to avoid purchase stops.Don't get euros in US - simply use ATM machine at airport in Spain & avoid ALL fees.Don't forget your electrical converters - bring extras for charging multiple devices.Barcelona has pickpockets.

We were given a room on the 17th room. Our first impressions were excellent, the bed is huge and very comfy, the bathroom is spacious and amazing, the shower was brilliant. But the room was not maintained at 5 stars at all. Hinges on cupboard were broken, wood was peeling away from the dressing table... We used all the 6 hangers we received instantly as there was two of us, i stayed in a hostel earlier in the year and even that gave us extra hangers... One of the biggest disappointments i had with my room was the fact there were two lines either side of the bed up the wall. Pencil or pealing away wallpaper? I'm unsure, but there were numerous messy screw holes either side and the wallpaper looked damp and stained towards the bottom. The electric curtain system didn't work at all, this would have been lovely to use in the morning as it was always sunny, i could hear the room next door using it fine. I also noticed that for some reason every other room on the floor had a peep hole on their door but ours for some reason didn't? I feel perhaps every room isn't in this state but we were definitely given the scrags... Not what i expect from a hotel rated 5 stars.We only had breakfast on the first day but 22 euros each is absolutely ridiculous, it was not enjoyable at all especially when in the centre of Barcelona you can pick up and full cooked breakfast for less that half the cost. Speaking of the centre of Barcelona, getting there is a fair trip. I enjoyed using the shuttle bus, but it has only 13 seats, strange for such a large hotel, we often found there were too many people to fit and twice had to pay for a taxi instead. The bus is regular but the times are a little awkward, the last bus back is 8:20pm, most people in Barcelona don't start eating until after this time, so you'll end up using taxis a lot, unless youre happy to sit on the metro until the very last stop, the metro in Barcelona has very poor air conditioning and it just makes for a very long, hot, uncomfortable journey.As a round up, I did find the hotel comfortable and enjoyed my stay.

What a feeling it was to arrive at such a beautiful, immaculate place. We arrived earlier than check in, at around 12:30pm, and expected to just spend the day at the pool/bar for some snacks waiting around for our room but the receptionist informed us our room was ready already, which was fantastic news!! I had made my booking for two nights separately as I couldn't find the two nights online anywhere and was anxious we wouldn't be able to stay in the same room for the two nights, but the gent at reception (tall, blonde male) accommodated us perfectly and had it all sorted out within minutes. We had our friends with us who were due to travel back to Scotland that evening on a later flight, and when we asked if we could have them spend the day at the pool with us this wasn't a problem, totally accommodating with them even when they weren't guests at the hotel - they did have to pay the extra €12 each for this but the spa is definitely worth that! The hotel also allowed them to get the free transfer to the airport (as long as there was space after guests had gotten in it, which is totally understandable) and this just made their last day so much easier. They were so grateful for all of the receptionists help. My boyfriend and I had room service the first night as we were knackered, and because we had the duplex suite it was lovely to just sit in our bathrobes with a gorgeous meal, bottle of prosecco and a STUNNING view of Barcelona right from our suite living area. We couldn't have wished for a better service from the gent who delivered our food, and the hot box under the table to keep our food perfect temperature was an added element to making our first night so lovely. The table was set lovely and was just what we needed. The room was to die for as well, as we walked in we all gasped with a great reaction and felt so happy we were here for the next two nights. The jacuzzi upstairs in the bedroom viewing Barcelonas stunning skyline was just the icing on the cake. Reception the following day were fab, Laura spoke fantastic English and helped us with advice of how to get to sagrada familia - using the metro service just 5 minutes walk away from the hotel - fantastic! So easy to use as well with the t-10 ticket which two of us could use for up to 10 journeys for the next couple of days, all for €10! After our day of sight seeing we decided to stay local at the hotel again and eat here. This time we got ready and ventured to the restaurant and my goodness was this amazing!!! Edwin was fantastic, what a pleasure it was to have him to look after us. Service was fantastic - totally 5 star, if not better! We had booked for 10pm, and I did feel like a pest to arrive so late, but as soon as we arrived at the restaurant we were welcomed with open arms and made to feel very important to the waiters and again so looked after. The meal was again stunning, food was to die for! The teriyaki pork was just out of this world I loved every mouthful, my boyfriend had the razorfish risotto and he also loved it. We really wish our stay didn't have to end, the whole experience was amazing!! We had access to the tower club as well which was just such a fabulous bonus. I had initially bought this stay as a birthday present for my boyfriend, but I enjoyed it just as much as he did and felt like we had both received a fantastic gift staying here. We would 110% stay here again if visiting Barcelona, easy access to the airport with the free shuttle bus and town, taxis aren't even too expensive to get into the busier part of the city - and again the metro is a superb option just 5 minutes away. There is a shuttle bus service for different places like the beach and different parts of the city but we didn't have a chance to use this: The only negative thing is maybe the carpets need a wee revamp, but everything else is a definite 5 star standard. Thank you for an amazing last few nights to our trip! We will definitely return one day!

The location is fantastic and the buzz of Paseig de Gracia and neighbouring streets made it an easy selection for us.Due to a last minute flight change we added an additional night at the start of the booking for which we had to book a suite. This was located on the 7th floor underneath the restaurant. The room i have to say was dated, no bigger than a normal room in most cities and aside from the terrace area was just average.Based on the fact that the next 4 nights would be in a standard room i was worried what we would find. In fact the standard room had been renovated and was more comfortable, clean and welcoming than the suite. It did have a smaller bathroom and obviously no terrace, but the room itself was far more to our liking than the suite. Our only moan about the room was that the fridge is actually a vending machine with a touch screen, meaning a our young daughter kept ordering items that on check out, they didn't refund, even though they were still in the fridge and more importantly we were not able to store any milk, fruits etc in the fridge for the kids, not at all practical for anyone let alone families. That said the baby cot was waiting for us in both rooms which is always a nice relief!Another reason for choosing the hotel was the pool, although small it offered a nice opportunity for the kids to cool down mid afternoon, unfortunately it was so cold that even our superhero obsessed son was only brave enough to last 5 mins and our daughter and I didn't even brave it at all. Its such a small pool it can't be difficult to maintain temperature control.We didn't dine or drink in the hotel and as mentioned there are some great outlets close by including a little mini mart and a Costa for the coffee junkies.I would stay here again but for the cost it certainly wouldn't be our first choice.",4,Overall good but left just a little underwhelmed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d229677-r501183916-Condes_De_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,got2bfunky

Sometimes we would let the water run and run, and it it would never get hot. At other times, no water whatsoever would come out of the hot water side of the faucet or shower. We reported this to the front desk staff several times each day and were always told the same thing: ""maintenance is working on it."" When I asked when it would be fixed, they said they didn't know. This made planning our days very difficult since we never knew when we were going to be able to shave, shower, etc. I understand that things break down, and that often it cannot be avoided. But the real problem was there was absolutely no sense of urgency. The front desk staff seemed like they were tired of people asking about it.

It's walking distance to Plaza Cataluna and Passeig de Gracia, where major shops are located. You can also walk around Barrio Gotica where you have small alleys with endless shops and restaurants. Despite being right smack in one of Barcelona's busiest sections, the noise didn't reach our room even if we were only on the 2nd floor. My only complaint was, we got a triple room and it was a bit too small. A king sized bed and a pull out bed. We hardly had space to open our luggages. When we checked in (check in time was supposedly at 3pm but the room was ready at 4pm), the third bed was not made yet and concierge told us it would be ready by 6pm. When we got back at 10pm, the bed was not yet made and I had to call reception again. It took housekeeping 30 mins to sort this out. Sadly, the pull out bed had only a thin mattress and was not comfortable at all. For the price, we expected proper beds.Aside from this, service at Le Meridien is excellent! Check in and check out were seamless and the staff is always at your service.

The pool bar area was nice to sit and relax in the evening. A bit pricey for food and drinks on the roof terrace. The ground floor hotel bar never seemed to be open. We had a look at the menu for dinner but didn't like what was being advertised and so never ate there. Our room rate which wasn't cheap did not include breakfast either, we ended up having breakfast locally for very little. The hotel is in a central location for the busy la rambla, harbour area and for bus or boat tours also for local markets. plenty good bars and restaurants nearby. Cleanliness was a bit of an issue.

The apartment has the kitchen / table / sofa bed in one room and the bedroom with an on suite (the only bathroom). When we arrived, we were given our room keys and went up to the room. On the room door there was a 'do not disturb' sign. We knocked on the door, no reply. I opened the door to be faced by a man asleep in the sofa bed in the middle of the room. The staff at the front desk had given us the keys to an already occupied room!!!! I quickly apologized and shut the door, going down to the reception to get another key. I don't know if this kind of thing happens a lot, but it has never happened to me before and I was really shocked about it (the joke for the rest of the week was whether the staff had given our door keys to anyone when we were out!). The rooms are nice and we were very appreciative of the air conditioning. In terms of the kitchen, it's not very well equipped (there's no cleaning equipment, there's no large spoons or anything to stir food in the pans (we had to use a fork!) we had to go downstairs to get a corkscrew, tea and coffee wasn't replenished until the end of the four night stay (when they thought we'd left, cancelled our cards and locked us out of the room!) The overall impression we got was that you weren't really meant to use the kitchen. In terms of staff, the woman running the bar / restaurant deserves a pay rise, as she was lovely and the food at the hotel was reasonable. The solarium on level 6 has views over to Torre Glories, which lights up from about 9:30 at night. Location wise, the hotel is in a good location close to the metro (Marina) and the Tram and is in a quiet neighborhood. It's just a couple of stops into the centre of Barcelona. Overall, it was ok. We won't be rushing to book again anytime soon.

In the morning, we had a visit from a big cucaracha in the room. At the check-out the clerk at the reception asked us how the stay was. I said we were hungry on arrival, and the check-in took too long. We were not happy about the cleaning, as there was a big cucaracha in the room. A few days later we called in to ask for a leftover gadget. However, as it was charging in the bathroom, easy visible, it was not found by the cleaning crew.The normal compensation for a stay in a hip hotel like The Mirror would be to offer a week-end stay for free, however it seems like this hotel has some management problem.",1,Bad experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2018633-r507289653-The_Mirror_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,moozewine

I would stay here again in the future. There are a couple things that I think the hotel could change to make it a much more, a 5 star visit: Clean the pool area. We wanted to use the pool but not. Two occasions there was either a large party hoarding the pool OR the area surrounding it was dirty (full of dishes and generally a mess) from other guests, which detracted from the experience and caused us to go elsewhere. The AC in our room was ok.. it was hot while we were in Barcelona.. so AC was key in picking a hotel. The system in my room (119) was lacking and could not keep up.. even on high output. Also, the strange setup of the room where you enter the room to two other doors (one to the bathroom and one to the sleeping area) while nice because of privacy... was strange because the AC could not flow to the bathroom making it incredibly hot all the time.

Everything was great except for this hotel it was the only negative experience of my entire trip. Were we not so exhausted from our international flight upon arrival we would've certainly gone elsewhere. We paid extra to have a triple room, and there was nothing triple about it. With the extra bed put in the room it was nearly impossible to open the closet door, which was by the way the only place to put our clothes which was ridiculously insufficient. The air-conditioner barely functioned, blowing out almost no cold air. When we complained about this they tried to convince us that it worked perfectly which was a terrible way to handle the situation and a total shame. Located a few feet from our room was a cart of cleaning supplies. This made the entire hallway smell terrible, which was disgusting for any hotel let alone one of this supposed caliber. And for the icing on the cake, our room was filled with construction noise from some construction project which they supposedly did not know the origin of. Nobody got a good nights sleep while we were there. We wrote an email to management with no reply, clearly they do not care. There are plenty of other hotels in Barcelona.

We explained our need for a safe and asked for another room but were told they could not change the room. I called reception again and they offered us another room. After changing rooms, that safe's readout again stated ""batt"" (the same as the first room that we had). I went down to reception again and was told by a person there (a blond female reception staffer) who informed me that the safe was not working because our computer was too large. I told her that the safe easily accommodated the computer at which time she repetitively insisted that I was wrong. Another reception person came to the room and he confirmed that there was no issue with the computer size. He was able to get the safe to lock.

A very spacious twin bedded room with black-out curtains, air con, safe in wardrobe, plenty of storage, flat screen tv with many channels in different languages, full length mirror and very comfy beds. Big bonus were the doors opening onto a sweet little balcony with table and chairs and views down the main road. The room was very quiet at night. Slept really well. Free wifi worked fine. Good lift to all floors. Bathroom was also spacious with bath and shower. Good water temp and pressure. Windows opened which is always good when it's hot. Nice toiletries supplied.Breakfast served till 10.30. What a spread. Selection of hot foods, cold meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, cereals, yogurts, cakes and pastries, rolls and toast, huge selection of hot drinks and very nice fresh juices. All fresh and replenished right up until 10.30. All staff so friendly and helpful. Happy to advise on buses and metros. Fontana Metro station 4 mins walk - handy supermarket and ice cream parlour on the way (this line L3 took us to nearly all the places we wanted to visit - got to know it really well!) 2 stops to centre of city. Had ordered BCN Hola 3 day card before leaving so just had to collect cards from machine at metro at airport. Really easy to get from/to airport this way. Used our cards many times on buses and metro so certainly good value for the cost (38 Euros for 2 people). I don't understand why this hotel only has 2 stars - I've stayed in 3 and 4 star hotels that were not as good.

We LOVED our stay, the hotel and the staff. We thought the hotel was beautiful. The room where breakfast is served is really nice. The rooms were large and the bathrooms are AMAZING!! The rooftop terrace views are RIDICULOUS!! It's the view of the Ports and it's gorgeous!! Yes, the pool is small but we weren't there for that - the beach is across the street. There are plenty of tables if you'd like to sit but only about 6 lounge chairs. We would go up for a cocktail everyday - otherwise we were running around the city. If we had more time we may have lounged near the pool - it didn't bother us really. The location is EVERYTHING!! You are close to the Port, Barceloneta, Las Ramblas, and in the Gothic Quarter. The only reason why it would be bad is because it's hard to pull yourself out of the area to visit outlying neighborhoods!! Really, we were able to walk everywhere. This was our favorite area of Barcelona.Breakfast was incredible! The spread was perfect and food fresh. You are also able to pick how you'd like your eggs made. That right there was a home run for my husband and I. I wish I remembered the woman's name that handled the breakfast - but either way, she was great! Very friendly and very efficient and she maintained the breakfast area wonderfully. The bellboy - was super friendly as well (I think his name was Ruben). He was always smiling and interactive and always tried to help us if we needed anything at all. We really appreciated him.I will be honest, some of the front desk people are friendlier than others. Some were really amazing and some were ok. None were terrible or anything - but when you have people that are amazing the others stand out. LOL - BUT - all are helpful if you need anything. LONG STORY SHORT - we LOVED Barcelona. It was our first time and certainly not our last. We were there in July and are already booked to go back in September. Before we left - we booked our next stay here. We will make this our home whenever we come to Barcelona. Next time we will have a Port View Room, which we are happy about. Our room had no view and nor did I expect one - so big deal. I explained that we'll be coming back and already booked. They offered us a 10% discount for being a returning customer.OH - the WiFi worked great as well.

A day into our trip we also came home to a cold bottle of cava sat on the side with their good wishes. We also went to Hotel Majestic, the sister hotel which is a five minute walk away.

It is also only a 5-10 minute walk from Placa de Catalunya, and the top of La Rambla, and a short walk from the Barri Gotic and El Born areas. Being located a short walk from all these areas also means that it is in a quieter area than some hotels in Barcelona, and we found it very peaceful each night and easy to get a good nights sleep.The room itself was spacious enough for 2 people, and had a comfortable bed, a nice bathroom with a very large shower, shower gel and shampoo and a hairdryer, a safe, and a lovely little balcony/terrace area, which had a couple of seats and was a lovely place to sit and have a snack, and overlooked a quiet courtyard type area. The room also had a minibar, which was just a small fridge which we used to put our own drinks/snacks in and was incredibly useful. The air conditioning in the room worked perfectly, making the room a lovely cool temperature to retreat in to when it was nearly 40 degrees outside!The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful, and were quick to respond to emails that I had sent them before booking the hotel.There is a restaurant next door if you would like to buy breakfast or dinner. We didn't visit the restaurant though so can't say if the food was good. The hotel has a rooftop bar, which we visited on one evening and wish we had managed to visit more often. The man serving was very friendly and had a bit of a joke with us, the drinks were good and a reasonable price and the atmosphere was great. It wasn't a huge area but it was nicely done and we would recommend having at least one drink up there.As said in the title, the hotel definitely deserves more than 2 stars and we would 100% stay here again, as we could not find another hotel with a private balcony, rooftop bar, private bathrooms and minibar for the same price. It is a lovely hotel in a great location and fully recommended by us!",5,"Don't let the 2 stars put you off, definitely deserves more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d503136-r507459276-Hotel_Constanza_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Charbubbles

We chose this because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed. This definitely feels more than a 2 star! Check in was good with the receptionist spending a lot of time pointing out things on the map for us and answering our questions. Room was one of the best we stayed in with small balcony overlooking the front of the hotel. The location was in a quiet area just off plaza de Catalunya but within walking distance of La Ramblas and shopping area. We were 10 minutes from El Born a lovely area with good restaurants and bars. We used the metro which was a handy way to see the city and very good value if you bought the 10 ticket deal. Nearest met was Urquinaona. They have a roof top bar here which was lovely but underused which is a shame but on the plus side we always found a table.,5,Fantastic hotel in great location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d503136-r507823338-Hotel_Constanza_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,SGLEND

(FYI...You can usually only get this type of room when you order online directly through the hotel's website). For our family visit of 3 people, it was a very functional set-up. We had a king size bed for the 2 of us and a single bed for our teenage daughter. There was another single daybed that we used to put our luggage. The bathroom set-up worked well for us. We had a single stand-alone shower in one area. Then, there was a second shower/tub/toilet. Having 2 separate shower areas was great for getting ready more quickly. In between both showering areas, there was a fairly large area with a sink, big mirror, magnifying mirror, and all of the various toiletry items as well as a blow dryer. We had wonderful robes and thick towels. They had champagne and chocolates waiting for us in the room. They had many different pillow sizes and a card that allowed you could choose the fragrance of you room. The room was quiet and the A/C worked great. We had troubles with the safe and had to call them 3 separate times to get it resolved which they finally did by changing it out for a new one. The room had a table, desk, coffee maker, and mini refrigerator which was stocked with drinks and food though we did not buy any of their products. Instead, we walked to a grocery store that was only a short 5 minute walk away behind the hotel. The view was wonderful for water lovers like us, though know that the balcony is just big enough to stand on to gaze over the harbor. There is no room for chairs out there. We were on the 4th floor and we could see over the trees... any lower floor and I'm not sure you would be able to see much except the trees. There are about 6 lanes of fairly busy traffic in front of the hotel but it is quite easy to cross and once you do, you can walk for miles on the waterfront boardwalk area. Plus, the land developers have dotted the area with palm trees to make it more visually appealing. You can get an idea if you use the satellite view on Google Maps. We were within 5-10 minutes walking distance to a tourist information booth at the end of Las Ramblas near the Christopher Columbus statue. In the same area are also several boat rides that you can sign up for rides/tours. We chose the large catamaran ""chill-out"" boat tour (live sax music) and it was one of our best memories from our trip as we took a cooler with cheese and crackers and ordered sangria while lounging on the giant boat talking to other people from around the world. The boat departed from that same area and was just a fantastic, relaxing experience. Through the tourist information booth, we also signed up for a tapas tour in the Gothic Quarter and a flamenco show in the El Born district. We also meandered to Las Ramblas to walk down the famous street. All of these activities were only about 10 minutes away from the hotel so super convenient and walkable. We took a taxi for La Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell as they are located much farther away. We also took a taxi up to the beaches near Port Olympic. It was walkable in about 25-30 minutes but we were carrying a bunch of beach stuff so it was easier to just get a ride. Note that it is best to catch the taxi on the opposite side of the street of the hotel if you are heading north to the beach since the roads are one way! We paid extra to head south, turn around at the Las Ramblas roundabout and head north again passing our hotel along the way. Not a huge price difference but learned quickly to cross the street to save time and a bit of money! :) There are tons of food places nearby. There are upscale seafood places and cute little beach bars known as chiringuitos right on the water. In the historic area right behind the hotel there are tons of little cafes and shops. However, our first night we sat at the rooftop bar eating tapas and drinking sangria. Service was crazy slow as expected based on prior reviews, but we were not in a hurry and we thoroughly enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop watching the sunset and seeing the Barcelona skyline go from day to night. There is a small plunge pool up there but don’t expect to be able to actually swim in it. The pool is more for just getting wet to cool off before going back to the lounge chairs to bask in the sunshine or read a book in the shaded area. On our final morning, I saw other guests bring their free champagne up to the rooftop and they enjoyed it overlooking the city. We did not do this but in hindsight seemed like a pretty good idea! After our sunset, rooftop dinner, we headed out to walk the area nearby. We went further and further mesmerized by all the activity and the great people watching. We went so far that my feet began to hurt and I did not want to walk back! We took a rickshaw ride back to the hotel! Great way to cover a lot more area quickly and easily and way more ambiance than a taxi ride! Each morning we went to the breakfast room which used to be the palace stables. It was a beautiful room and a wonderful buffet full of interesting goodies. The menu offered various hot eggs. We tried something different each day…veggie omelets, ham and cheese omelets, scrambled eggs with chorizo, fried eggs. All were good and beautifully presented. There were also cereals, fresh fruit, hams, cheeses, yogurts, cereals, fresh squeezed juice, pastries, green beans with ham, baked tomatoes, Spanish potato/egg tortillas, spinach tortillas, and so much more. The breakfast workers did a great job of keep everything full but you may have to flag them down to order your eggs as they get sometimes get very busy and are unable to take your order. As for the other workers, the front desk workers were professional. We had especially attentive service from Alex the concierge and I enjoyed talking to Marc who was friendly and eager to assist which I always appreciate when traveling to new areas. Overall, it was a lovely hotel in a very good, central location for most that we wanted to do. The wifi worked well and was included in the bill I thought the overall hotel was a bit pricey but I am a water person and love a good rooftop view so for me it was worth it. The fact that it took 3 visits by staff and 2 days to get a working safe did cause me to knock it down a star. Other than that issue, I would recommend this hotel and this area to stay in!!",4,"Port views, rooftop bar, wonderful breakfast, 2 showers, super functional!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d259360-r505079609-Hotel_Duquesa_de_Cardona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,snickes

We had to take the train, how fortunate it was that the hotel was just across from the train station, it made a big difference to us.Breakfast on the 23rd floor was fantastic and spacious with the added bonus of panoramic views of Barcelona, it was lovely. We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfasts here, the food was tasty and the friendly staff provided a first class service. Other good points are the amount of lifts available, if I recall there are 6, which were quick and fast. Reception staff were also friendly, polite and very helpful. The reason I only gave 4 stars was because of the noise of the air conditioning unit. I am a very light sleeper and found it difficult to drop off with the noise, but I have that same problem with any hotel.Would I stay here again? definitely, the Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya provided everything and is in a great location.",4,Great convenient hotel which provided an excellent service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d289670-r508219474-Gran_Hotel_Torre_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,carol m

The décor and cleanliness of the property is top notch, only knock on the location is that the east end of the street has a lot of homeless and kind of run down. By Europe standards these are large rooms, and have what appears to be mostly new furnishings and very modern amenities - definitely goes with the artistic aesthetic that Barcelona is so well known for. Rooms are very quiet with newer dual paned windows - from out in the hall we could hear the crazy German couple next door screaming at each other but inside our room with door closed it was still very quiet and peaceful. WiFi worked very well, fast. We did not try the breakfast as the room was already a little pricey, on the high end of the scale, and it was just as easy to find coffee and pastry nearby. Right next door to the hotel is one of Spain's famous (and huge) Corte Ingles department stores, and if you head up to the 9th floor there's a large cafeteria with nice views of the Plaza Catalunya, decent prices, and a great selection of typical Catalan food.

Instead we enjoyed breakfast at many nearby restaurants especially on Passeig de Sant Joan street, just east of the hotel.The roof top bar and pool is a huge bonus. For us it was a meeting point in the morning and the place to have last drink before going to bed. They had great mojitos and nachos.Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Podium and would recommend it to other travellers who have similar preferences.",5,Lovely stay at NH Podium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d206920-r508562042-NH_Collection_Barcelona_Podium-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,GranFanToronto

The streets around the hotel are nice to walk through and it is a two minute stroll to the Arc de Triomf. The rooms were excellent, really well maintained and very fashionable. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with a nice shower and bath. Last but not least was the rooftop pool.

Hotel staff members were generally pleasant and professional. I especially appreciated the young gentleman at the front desk who helped me get my laptop to connect with the hotel Internet. I will long remember the warm smiles of Karen, one of the staff at the breakfast and afternoon tea buffets. She was very attentive to guests and I enjoyed talking with her briefly a couple of times when she was not too busy. We enjoyed everything about this hotel: very comfortable bed and room; excellent breakfasts in a very nice dining/lounge area; the terrace; the computer and library area; and the neighborhood.

We did not have breakfast included as was cheaper for us to go to a nearby cafe. An amazing extra the hotel provided was free afternoon snacks from around 17:30pm if I remember rightly and it was delicious; sandwiches, cakes etc and all homemade.

But the truth is that this Hotel gives off the air of a business hotel and a conference centre, with no soul or atmosphere. If you are a family don't go here - stay at the W. There was a queue(!!) for the lifts, and the staff did not even use their own elevator but instead used the guest lift!! Not very useful when there is a queue and nobody can get a lift-the paying customers should get priority I think??The swimming pool was as small as a fish tank. The water was as cold as the atmosphere - for a hotel with 40 floors surely there should have been a greater amount of space dedicated to a leisure area?? Furthermore - there were no changing rooms on the pool level - disappointing for a five star hotel. On the contrary when we visited the W hotel - which was cheaper (!) -we saw it had multiple panoramic pools, large and spacious enough for a luxury hotel.The food was another problem. Our first meal at the pool bar cost us upwards of 150 euros for a family of 4! The pizza was ridiculously overpriced for an oily piece of bread that would have costed 3 euros at max to make - but was sold at over 20 euros!! Just because this is a 'luxury' hotel doesn't give you a licence to rip customers off. At the W where we ended up eating in nearly every night; there was a beautiful terrace with multiple restaurants by the beach serving tasty food which wasn't horrendously priced.Credit where credit is due, a positive for the hotel arts was that the breakfast was very tasty. Plenty of choice and great quality - the spread was very good and it exceeded my expectations.The rooms were a bit outdated but the rain shower was excellent and the views were nice. The service was fine - everyone was very pleasant but when coming to deal with certain pressing issues we had, the front desk failed to respond or get back to us on time. In conclusion, this was just underwhelming. If you want to come here as a family, you will be stuck with nothing to do inside! Although it is 'close' to the city centre, so are most of the other good hotels; and this hotel simply seemed like a business facility.

We were scheduled to arrive on Sunday afternoon, but unfortunately, due to weather conditions, our flight into Chicago was delayed and we missed our connector flight to Barcelona. Thus, we ended up arriving Monday morning. I did email the hotel the night before to notify them of our situation, and they promptly replied that they would hold the room for us.  Once we arrived at the hotel, one of the hotel staff walked up and greeted us by our name even before we introduced ourselves. She told us that she had a surprise for us which ended up being an upgrade to a much nicer/bigger room with a terrace overlooking Plaza Cantalunya. Having just experienced an unplanned sleepover in Chicago without our luggage, getting rerouted to New York before flying out to Barcelona, and then to top it off, American Airlines lost one of our bags, we were very appreciative of this little surprise.  The room was exceptional and the view from the terrace was beautiful. This hotel had everything: excellent customer service, perfect location to see downtown Barcelona, and great rooms with delicious breakfast. I especially loved walking through the Gothic Quarters and Las Ramblas which was just steps away. There was also a department store just around the corner where you could get just about everything including food in the lower level which they had the food court and market.We only had time for one of Gaudi's building, so we chose Casa Batllo which was the closer of the two. Once we started our tour, we also visited Sagrada Familia which was beautiful and Guell Park. So definitely, choose this hotel if you could get a reasonable rate. We booked through Expedia and chose the non-refundable rate. You'll end up paying more for this hotel than others farther away, but it's totally worth it since you don't have to pay for transportation ie. taxis or train for nearby attractions. From the airport, we were able to get on the Aerobus which cost about 12 euros round trip per person to/from the hotel. It stops almost right in front of the hotel.

Negatives:- (they're very minor and would not deter us from staying there again)It's a very minor issue. Our room had a nice rain shower which worked very well, but the shower base was a bit slippery and was too flat to effectively drain the water away fast enough.

The hotel is very nice - rooms, beds, cleanliness, breakfast, pool, etc., but what really influenced my 5-star rating was the customer service. The entire staff was helpful and able to communicate very well in English and other languages. They went above and beyond to help in anyway they could.

Besides, the shower booth did not close well, and after the shower, the bathroom became drenched and it was hard to even wash it.What is really funny is that the room I made the next day did not have any of this.

The hotel itself is well equiped with excellent Jo Malone amenities and a generous mini bar which should get replenished everyday as part of the offering of complimentary soft drinks, juice, water and snacks. Unfortunately this didnt happen with many items not being replenished each day in either of our families rooms. Its these little details that can let them down. Breakfast at the hotel, while service is slow, is excellent. The quality of the food is high and the variety is large. Having breakfast cooked fresh for you is a nice touch along with the platter that is provided when you arrive which includes fresh ham, cheese and pastries The room configuration we had was a little unusual as there is small lounge attached to the bedroom which is dark and something you would struggle to utilise (room 103) Another issue with this room is that the Metro train service runs directly under the hotel and every 3-5 minutes you can hear and feel the vibrations in the room. Very difficult to sleep as the Metro runs from 5:00 a.m. to approx 1:00 a.m. But to give the hotel credit, they moved us to another room on a higher floor which was superior to our original room and thus very generous of them. Its important to note that you can still hear the Metro (room 503) but the vibrations do not have the same impact.The quality of the shower is excellent and powerful and the beds are soft and comfortable. There is also a pillow menu which is great touch. Many of the staff were great but the staff at front of house let the hotel down (having turned away our transfers leaving us to get taxis back to the airport). This still happened after we advised the reception staff that transfers would be arriving at a certain time, with them commited to advising the front of house this information.

My experience around the world has been extremely reliable and Barcelona was no different. The way their rooms are designed is especially a favourite for me - very practical, well thought out and stylish. Best of all they are well sound-proofed, from the outside as well as the foyers and we were near the lifts, it was whisper quiet.The facilities comparative to the size of the hotel was the biggest con for me. The pool/rooftop bar combined is spectacular on first glimpse. The gym is right next to this on the same floor. But it was completely overrun by children (not complaining, I had a 5 year old) but there were too many people all of the time and not enough division between each area i.e. gym vs bar to get a noticeable reprieve. There were never enough seats, locations to set your things down and we were over it pretty quick.  The gym is also overrun by children who want to 'check' out the equipment - not sure where parents were and surprised children were allowed into this area.The location was a 20 min walk to Segrada Familia but we had an 83 yo and 5 yo in our party so was perhaps a bit out of the way. The local underground we struggled to find until the last day, yet it is very close (stupid on our part perhaps) and the tram line is a nice trip into the port.There are also only 3 lifts which are tiny and there was high frustration by many coming and going, especially flight crew who stay here and were trying to catch transfers. I heard several people complain. I did think the staff did a good job of trying to accommodate our requests, they were attentive and friendly. My ongoing frustration with Accor Hotels is that while it is lovely to have a special check-in desk for Accor members - it is (a) never manned and (b) your loyalty is never acknowledged when you step up to be checked in.

Hairdryer, dressing gowns and slippers to. The bed was very comfortable and although at the front no noise from the road below.The pool at the top is small but enough to just cool off and chill in at the end of the day. The lady in the bar up here was great and never seemed to stop, her cocktails were to die for.The Gallery cafe to side of hotel was a bit hit and miss, I dont think they had the attention to detail as the rest of the staff. We had an evening meal with the music night and the food and service was good. We had pre and after dinner drinks most night from the bar sitting outside which was delightful. Matias, Mustafa served us very wel over the course of our stay but Bashir stood out from the crowd. He was always so welcoming, remembered our drinks, made pleasant conversation and made us all laugh, he really was first class and genuinely seemed pleased to greet us.Breakfast was lacking a bit in organisation, it all seemed a bit chaotic when sometimes coffee and juices were outside but then not the next day, had to go search for jams/salt n pepper that sort of thing, but the food on offer was again very nice and plentiful.Olga checked us in and a nice touch is the way she gave us a guided tour of the hotel and a few tips to get the best out of our trip.

It is also a major shopping avenue. To the right one block is another great shopping street. There are also many restaurants and cafes nearby. The location is definitely GREAT for walking. If you want to take a tour, the stops for both Hop on- Hop off tours is also about a block away as well.The hotel itself is very nice. The lobby and dining areas are comfortable and accommodating. The dining room offers a morning “ European” breakfast. There is also a rooftop pool and bar. It is a great place to relax after a day of shopping. The pool is not very big, and isn’t really for kids, but for adults to take a quick dip, it would be fine.The room I stayed in was of ample size with a queen bed, and 2 nightstands, a desk and lounging chair.

The hotel has a very nice exclusive feel to it, owing to the lower number of rooms that you find in more tourist centric hotels. This works out great, as the hotel never felt crowded while we were there, save for one night where the rooftop bar was packed owing to an event (timing on our part, in no way the fault of the hotel). Hotel breakfast was very good, though they would run out of bacon before I got my shot at it, again this was probably more due to bad timing on my part (more than a couple of late nights beforehand). The only minor gripe I would have is the duration of the pool hours, just felt that 8 PM was a bit early to close the pool off especially given the summer heat in Barcelona. That said, a minor issue, and in no way did it affect the experience for the rest of the stay.Staff were great, and our concierge Eri went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of.

Step out the door and one is immiedately into the maze narrow streets and alleys - some not even wide enough for a vehicle - that make up the Barcelona of old. These medieval streets - mostly pedestrianised - are lined with cafes, taverns, resturants and of course tapas bars and often lead into unexpected squares (where cafes/bars have room for outdoor tables) or on to the Ramblas (Barcelona's most famous street) itself which is only a short distance from the hotel.The hotel is very modern inside - I suspect recent refurbishment - and the staff are very friendly and helpful - and English-speaking! The room is compact but boasts a decent bathroom with a very good shower. Our room had a large balcony complete with table and chairs and even a sun-lounger! Despite being right beside the Cathederal we were never disturbed by a single bell - and the A/C was argueably the quietest I've ever encountered in a hotel room!The only tiny draw-back we encountered was that the room's balcony was accessed by a very steep portable step.

Upon arrival hotel looked very well kept but once you looked around nothing was really clean. Check in was quick but kind of left to our own devices. Was pointed to the lift n was just told floor2, they didn't tell us we had to put our room card in the lift before it'd go anywhere. The room was clean(ish) definitely hasn't been wiped over but wasn't the end of the world. The bed was comfy and was fairly big and our room over looked the pool area, a tad disappointed there were no hot drink making facilities. The hotel definitely isn't in the centre. I didn't the find the area visually appealing as other areas I've stayed in Barcelona but it was what it was. We can use the metro and there was one close by so that wasn't an issue. The nearest eating places is about 7 blocks across from the hotel on the road Rambla del poblenou. I found the staff weren't very helpful in guiding us there. We used the metro a lot as we've been to Barcelona a couple of times and it's easier to access better areas such as la ramblas etc. The spa at the hotel AVOID! The staff there have disgusting attitudes. We didn't even make it for any treatments as we wasn't wasting money on people that were rude and couldn't give a toss! When we booked we were told we had full access to the outdoor & indoor facilities.... this isn't true as upon arrival you have to pay €15 to use the indoor pool per day unless you book a suite. The outdoor poor area was ok but definitely not big enough nor no way near enough sun beds to cater for the amount of guests at the hotel. On the day of check out we were allowed to still use the outside facilities and were told by reception we was allowed to use the spa facilities to freshen up before we headed to the airport. Again the spa tried to charge us and for towels!! After a brief chat with the reception manager this was overturned and we wasn't charged much dismay of the disgruntled spa reception staff. All in all for the little time we spent at the hotel it was ok but the service was poor and I wouldn't chose this particular hotel again.

From there a person explained our room and every detail and Susanna made sure that everything worked out for us. She made sure that our stay was special. I was very impressed with the rooftop deck and the pool area and it was very busy at midnight and just wonderful. I was able to book this on Expedia with my flight and so I believe I got a very good rate . I've been to a lot of hotels and traveled often and I would say this is been one of the best hotels I've been to and it's walking distance to everywhere and I especially love the marble bathroom with the deep tub. If there was just one tiny thing that I would have preferred it might have been an expresso machine in the room that made -- real dark strong coffee -- instead of the automatic one that they have in there but that seems to be a typical thing everywhere. I would surely stay there again and it made Barcelona even nicer. Oh there was a man at the Rooftop area that allowed people in and out and very tall and slender... he was quite arrogant and unfriendly.

The check-in and concierge area is very confusing. When we arrived we were shuttled around to the side for additional check-in area. The concierge and other check in area are together but they wear different colored jackets. Some of the people do both jobs. The hallways on the floors were beautiful and well decorated. Our room was very large but uninteresting. The long,narrow, drain in the shower was blocked and water went all over the floor. It was hard to understand how it had just become blocked. They did sent maintenance up right away to fix. The swimming pool bar area was great but very hard to get a seat. Beautiful views of city! Breakfast was very mediocre.

An amazing extra the hotel provided was free afternoon snacks from around 17:30pm if I remember rightly and it was delicious; sandwiches, cakes etc and all homemade.

We were greeted by a friendly security guard by the doors and a helpful, polite, multi language speaking lady who checked us in with a smile.The whole hotel smells lovely probably as a result of the spa in the basement.Our room had a 40 inch tv in it, although we only had 1 English speaking channel, room service was excellent and our room was tidied up every day. Electric beds and air con with black out curtains.. honestly me and mum felt like we weren't posh enough to be there!The rooftop pool and decking made us feel relaxed and secluded. Towards the end of the holiday it did become noisy and rife with what seemed like a school trip but can't fault the hotel on that. Did notice no life guard or staff on the roof though which may have been helpful.The spa is mainly a water experience with all kinds of different pools. This was peaceful and free for guests in the mornings which was a great way for us both to start each day. The buffet restaurant always seemed to be closed however we may have just missed opening hours as we were exploring the city every day.Only major fault is location.

In the basement there is a Spa, which if you book through certain companies gives you 2 hours free entrance each day. Treatments are available at cost shown in the rooms. Take up the two hours it's well worth it! We didn't use the restaurant so I can't comment on that. We also did not have breakfast as it was extra at either €12 or €15.

We went out for some lunch incidentally Spain does not cater for Coeliacs. We ended up buying chips and drinks from Burger King. We went back to the hotel at 2.30pm to be told the room was still not ready arghh. However the young lady on the desk was brilliant. I wish I had asked for her name, she quickly got us sorted with a room on 5th floor with a balcony. We were shown to our room by Victor who we liked very much he sorted out bags and quickly realised we only had 3 beds, he promised housekeeping would be up soon with another bed. We were all exhausted and very happy with our room. The girls had separate beds in an adjoining room and my husband and I had a huge bed. The linen was lovely and clean and the room smelt fresh and was very cool. Yes the room was tired looking and the shower wasn't great only adequate. The air conditioning was superb. I am diabetic so needed a fridge which was very cold. WE did go to the supermarket for water and juice. We also kept the cost down by buying ham, cheese, fruit and bread, as my husband had lost his job the week before our holiday so money was tight. The hotel do offer a good choice of bar food and we understand that the breakfasts are super. We only slept at the hotel then spent days out and about.

A sliding screen seperates the bedroom from the bathroom for thoses who prefer to retain a bit of modesty (see images).Breakfast is important, and this hotel offers a fully cooked quality breakfast along side the usual continental selection.

They have plenty of time for you and can offer maps showing you the local attractions.Getting to the hotel from the airport will cost around €35 by taxi or just over €4 by train. The train can be embarked on at the airport and will take you to within a 5 minute walk of the hotel. You may want to remember this in case the taxis are on strike, as they were when I visited!Any negatives? Well no, not really. Around midnight it can get a little noisy in the corridors due to guests returning to their rooms, but there again this is Barcelona so this will surely be the case in all hotels!As commented by others, the rooftop is a really pleasant area to relax and wind down.

The design of the hotel is modern and minimalistic, which is very appealing to me, and even though there are signs of wear and tear in the rooms the overall cleanliness and state of the hotel is perfectly adequate. My room was clean and very bright with floor-to-ceiling windows offering magificent views of Torre Glóries (Agbar). The air conditioning worked perfectly and a window could be opened for fresh air - a most welcome but everso uncommon feature in hotels nowadays. The design is very contemporary and attractive but certain details, ie the shower, are designed poorly without taking function into account; it was impossible to use the shower without soaking the entire bathroom. The hotel has a nice roof terrace with magnificent views of the surrounding area and also a small pool and restaurant/bar. I did not have any drinks and/or food at the hotel. Checking in and out was quick, efficient and friendly and all in all the stay was very hassle-free. The lifts, however, were somewhat dirty and extremely slow so I preferred using the stairs during my stay. The location is, in my opinion, excellent. Glóries metrostation is just down the street which means that all parts of Barcelona are easily accessed. The area itself is somewhat lacking in character and charm but is safe and clean with good transportation options and a major shopping complex just across the street. The nearest part of the beach is easily reached by a leisurely walk for roughly 20-25 minutes. As a whole, I'm very happy with my stay at Tha Gates Diagonal and I would gladly return to this hotel for my future travels to the lovely city of Barcelona!",4,The Gates Diagonal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d518349-r501413553-The_Gates_Diagonal_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,antewelen

For that, we are so grateful. As you can see from the lobby, a remodel should be considered in the near future. We were thoroughly pleased that there wasn't carpet on the floors.

If you you are a light sleeper or have children, this might be something you consider when selecting your room. In the United States, we are used to having washcloths, but apparently washcloths are a United States thing because we did not have any in our room. If you really need a washcloth, you may want to consider bringing your own. Speaking of the bathroom, the shower definitely needs some attention. There was a musty odor upon opening the shower door. There was mold on the walls of the shower, which may be the cause of the musty odor. Although we had paid for our hotel charges in advance, we owed a 5 euro local tax upon arrival that wasn't covered in the booking charges.

Even i saw the cleaning lady taking the bed civer from the room facing our and putting in our room instead of getting a new one.They have little staff if you want something you need to go down get it youself most of the time , even the bags we mived them by ourselves. They do keep your bags after checkout for free.Very friendly staff I must say always smiling . They don't have a tourists office but they try to help as much as possible.They offered us a wheelchair free of charge for my grandma and when we thanked them by a small present they have us free cake and sweets I Wwould thank (Mrs.Nuira) most helpfull of all for her kindness . She has definitely a good impact on your hotel and she gives the guests with a positive impression.They offer breakfast but its not a continental one I think 15€ is too expensive for a cold breakfast , you have many bakeries 2 mint walk away so no need.

The rooms are decently sized and clean and the morning breakfast was good. The only reason the review gets two stars and not one is because the first couple of nights my stay was actually pleasant but from the third it all went downhill extremely fast.So from the third day (I stayed 5 nights) I had a group of boys staying on the same floor as me. Their rooms were spaced out on the floor, one or two at the side of me and another down the hall. They used to get ready to head out (I'm guessing to party) around 11 in the night. So for a good 2 hours I could just hear them walking in and out of each others rooms, doors slamming, loud talking in the corridor (the sound proofing is appalling), they even used to open the back windows and talk and move stuff around in the room. This used to go on till about 1am and restart when they got back in around 6am - 7am.I called the reception the first night this happened, the person at the desk (Visily) said he would look into it and the noise did get toned down but the group also did head out for the night so I manged to get some sleep.The second night, the same issue continued and this time it was louder, so I went down to the reception, the person on duty (Visily again) denied there was a group staying on my floor when clearly there was, he said he had told them to keep it down and also surprisingly asked if I wanted to speak to them. Why should I as a guest in the hotel tell others guest to keep the noise levels down? Isn't it the duty of the hotel to make sure there is a proper sleeping environment for all guests? He did not look interested in helping so I just gave up and suffered through the third night as well.It is safe to say that I will never stay in this hotel again and if this is the type of service to be expected, i will definitely not consider any other hotels in this chain as well.",2,Terrible experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d275098-r506211703-Catalonia_Eixample_1864-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,AndreiBraganza

Both in our twenties. From the exterior the hotel is great, but disappoints slightly once inside (see pictures). We arrived in our room to find a used condom on the bathroom floor. The women on reception (morning shift) was insincere and simply told me that the cleaner would move it, no genuine apology. We didn't make a fuss, complain or ask to speak to management. Out all the things you don't want to find on your bathroom floor, a used condom would be up there. If we were an elderly couple or made more of a fuss I think we would have been taken more seriously, rather than brushed aside. The hotel pool area is lovely, however the pool itself looks very unclean. The hotel seems to be a popular place for large stag groups. If a group is in the pool you have not got a chance of relaxing in it. They can also be quite intimidating, a couple of times I witnessed two groups of females leaving the pool area after being pestered by groups of drunk men. The room is lined with wooden panels, all of which are chipped and worn. The shower curtain is inadequate, water leaks all over the floor and wooden door frame making it rot. The air-con temp is good / cold and we understand that aircon units are loud, but this one was the loudest we have ever experienced (and rattles). The two main roads at the side of the hotel make it impossible to sleep with the doors open.

It is not far from a lot of areas that are within walking distance, especially our favorite, El Born. A few years back we had stayed at Jardi and it was fine for us, but this time we have outgrown it. Our room, with a balcony overlooking the plaza and Church was delightful, yet a bit too small for us. The bathroom was tiny, with a shower that proved to be challenging for my husband. Apart from that, the a/c worked well, the bed was comfortable- would have been nice to have a small mini-fridge to keep water/drinks cool. The staff was very nice and accomodating when it came to questions.As far as breakfast, it was not consistent. The first day they had a basic buffet breakfast which consisted of croissants, baguette-like bread, yogurt, jam, butter, fruit, oatmeal, and drinks which included tea, coffee, milk, and chocolate mix. The next day we came down and there was nothing- just baguette-like bread and coffee. After a while we inquired and a couple of croissants were brought out... As I mentioned, we had been to Jardi a few years back, and it was what we expected. This time, the lack of space in the room and bathroom and the sparce breakfast was a bit uncomfortable. Yet, the location is fantastic, especially to be able to walk to so many areas and have access to public tranportation so easily. Barri Gotic is full of great tapas places and walking distance to other areas- we even made it to the beach, which was fun! When you venture to El Born, make sure to pay a visit to Sagardi Euskal Taberna for some great pintxos/tapas and fun!",3,"Great location, but a bit small.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d236209-r503002442-El_Jardi-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Linda17NewJersey

We had a professional conference at the convention center which is next to the AC Hotel Barcelona Forum- Easy walking distance to the metro. The Metro (underground subway) is very easy to navigate, very clean, air conditioned and staff are available to assist if you need help. Passengers are also a great source for help - the people of Barcelona are so helpful. Buy a multiday pass at the Barcelona airport or at the metro station.- Rooms are clean, clean, clean. The hotel staff are friendly and incredibly efficient. We appreciate the staff for their pride in keeping the rooms cleaned.- At the end of a long or hot day, take a quick dip in the pool. There are poolside loungers, tables and more tables inside the restaurant. The hotel can provide pool towels and the staff are very attentive. Enjoy a drink poolside - the view is absolutely beautiful!!- Across the street is the Diagonal Mall - lots of shopping, food choices and good restaurants (asian, italian, spanish...). We enjoyed an evening of tapas and paella which were very tasty and reasonably priced. A grocery story is located inside the Diagonal Mall - get some bread, wine, cheese, a bit of prosciutto and fruit for your hotel room! The selection at the grocery store is amazing and you won't be disappointed.- The hotel has a very good breakfast area with a wide selection of food. The service was incredible and the staff worked very hard to keep the food fresh and the tables clean. - The hotel room was very clean and kept clean every day. The beds were comfortable, the air conditioning functioned perfectly and the rooms had darkening shades. For an international traveler, these provided the right environment for a great night of sleep. - Beyond the obvious sights of Barcelona that are listed in Tripadvisor, don't miss the many unlisted churches (the architecture and relics are historical gems that cannot be found elsewhere, one church had a special staircase that led us to the most amazing rooftop views of Barcelona), a simple scoop of gelato by the waterfront, and the wonderful food/wines from the local restaurants.- From the hotel, it is a relaxing 10-15 minute walk to the beach. There were a lot of families, surfers, people playing sports, open showers and a few nude bathers. The beach area was well maintained and busy on a hot day.- Taxis can be found in front of the hotel. Very convenient. - And, most importantly, I have to mention the high level of service provided by the hotel staff at the AC Hotel Barcelona Forum. Near the end of our trip, the glass vanity in our bathroom became cracked. We informed the front desk staff immediately and returned from our city visit in the afternoon to find that the entire glass vanity in the bathroom was replaced (wow!). Front desk, housecleaning, restaurant, poolside - we received the best service from this team and truly appreciate how comfortable our stay was because of their efforts.Barcelona and its culture are worth exploring. We enjoyed the people, the food, the cultural sights and this was especially worthwhile because of the AC Hotel Barcelona Forum. Sharing our experience with others is important because traveling is expensive and helping others to know what to expect is important. Please do let me know if this review was helpful so that I am motivated to continue sharing my experience with others. We made a great choice with the AC Hotel Barcelona Forum (Marriott) and hope you enjoy Barcelona!",5,Loco for the AC Hotel Barcelona Forum - Perfect for Business Travelers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d501108-r506929057-AC_Hotel_Barcelona_Forum_by_Marriott-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,IMAbbyNormal

We also had planned to use our Marriott Reward points. By the time we got around to booking at the last minute, the available Marriotts in the area we limited, and the points required for the AC Forum seem reasonable. I called them directly and the staff was very friendly and accommodating in the phone, and we book two references for rooms. The booked them both on the seaside and because I'm a Marriott Gold Rewards member I got upgraded to a Junior Executive Suite. Both rooms were outstanding. The view is spectacular right on the Mediterranean. The staff could not have been more helpful. We spent time at a beach nearby, and a subway stop is nearby so we were easily able to get to the center city and attractions. We enjoyed it so much we stayed several days longer with a deal of paying half and redeeming half the points that would be required for a full point redemption stay. I'm sure there are more highly appointed Or centrally located Marriott's in Barcelona, but staying right on the beach / coast, with access to nice restaurants and close by train / subway transport, the spacious rooms and the helpful staff, we will stay there if we ever are lucky enough to get back to Barcelona.",5,Very Nice Experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d501108-r501323475-AC_Hotel_Barcelona_Forum_by_Marriott-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,SteveDelSig

However this very good room had some problems which lead to the mixed result experience with our stay. The beach view was nice if there is not a music event on the beach until 2am which kept us up. It was some kind DJ music event down the beach and it could be heard in the room. The other problem was the bed was not up to the Marriott standards which I'm use to, very uncomfortable. The breakfast was very mediocre much less than what I would have expected from a first class hotel. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel near the pool and had a very good dinner.

Restaurants, shops and a large open air market were within easy walking distance, as was the Flamenco Cordobes. In addition, we were able to walk to our meeting spots for our tours. Some say it is noisy. We had a room facing Las Ramblas. I opened the windows, stepped on the balcony and soaked in the exciting atmosphere.

Also the poble nou area is quite close (catch the tram outside the hotel doors) and is good for meals. We hired bikes and found it the best way to get into town. It's an area for music festivals in the forum area and conferences so may be higher prices at certain times. However it's much calmer and quieter than staying near la rambla or catalunya especially at peak times.There's a large mall across the road and some of the restaurants are quite good, we had great pinxtos at Sagardi.

Myself and 3 friends arrived for our first girls holiday to Barcelona and were welcomed with a friendly reception as we entered the quirky hotel. With little idea of how far we were from the tourist attractions we'd planned to visit, the receptionist whipped out a map and gave a swift and detailed summary of our closest metro stations, most accessible bus services and even the advised us on pre-booking some of the attractions we'd planned to visit. The rooms we'd booked (two doubles) were clean, spacious and extremely comfortable. We'd seen on the website that only a mesh curtain separated the bathroom from the bedroom, and as we were sharing between friends, we figured this would have been a bit intimate... however there was also a white curtain which could be drawn for privacy. (The loo had its own private room as well, thankfully). I have to say the beds were absolutely incredible. So comfortable, which was a dream to come back to after our long days/nights out. We spend a few afternoons and evenings on the spacious and modern rooftop area, enjoying the fantastic cocktails and soaking up the sunshine when we were a bit too tired to head down to the beach. Overall, I'd highly recommmend the hotel.

Very attentive and very concerned about their image. Of course the hotel was clean, modern, and the pool area was a great place to go after a long hot day trekking around Barcelona. my only complaint is one that is common in European hotels. There just needs to be more places to plug equipment in. Today people travel with so many pieces of equipment that need to be recharged at the end of the day, and with only one or two available receptacles and given the inconvenient European electrical receptacle design, it's just hard to get everything recharged for the next day. For any traveler, I suggest that you take a three-way American plug to plug into your European receptacle converter.

Exposed concrete walls and dark furnishings throughout, It is tastefully done however it is not to my liking. The bathroom however was well equipped with good facilities and plenty of shelf space. The bedroom was small and lacking a dressing table so very little room for personal belongings. There is no restaurant and alas no bar either which ruled out the odd G&T before dinner at the end of a hard day's sightseeing. The breakfast room in the basement was pleasant enough and the spread was satisfactory. There is a marked lack of staff in this hotel, there is no one to show you up to your room or anywhere else for that matter, it is a case of finding things out. There is a plunge pool on the roof terrace with a few sunbeds but no other facilities that we could see apart from a few tables and chairs, sadly there are no views of the city.

I am in a unique position for this review as I stayed in the basic double room and the master suite.Standard room; spacious, clean and floods with natural sunlight. The blackout and privacy blinds are fantastic, allowing you at have a good sleep in a comfy bed. The free minibar is limited, but it is free after all. The shower is fantastic, great water pressure and has therapeutic jets for a refreshing feel. We did have a flooding issue, but within 45minutes of reporting it, it had been fixated, cleaned and they had brought us champagne and chocolates as an apology. Fantastic customer service.Master suite; we decided as we were having such a good stay (and it was our anniversary), we would upgrade to the master suite for one night. It was a bit odd that the first time I asked about this, I was told it would be €250+. When I went to book, it was actually €150. The suite is lovely, loads of space and a confy sofa to relax on. The views are phenomenal, both during the days and in the evening, you can see over the city.Again, the hotel showed their customer service by bringing us complementary champagne and strawberries for our anniversary. The hot tub is also a great addition to your private terrace and sun loungers. The only gripe is that whilst we were in the hot tub (approximately 9:30pm) two cleaners came into the room, it was a bit of a surprise to see people walking around your space as you're relaxing outside, not something I was happy with really.The pools; we never actually made it to the top pool, it's very small and only as about 6 sun lounges. The pool on the 3rd floor has more space but filled up quickly and doesn't get the sun for long (it's in shade at about 3pm). The food; the food, unfortunately, is below par. Very expensive for what it is, poor quality and didn't match the standard of the rest of the hotel in my opinion. The breakfast was average, nothing particularly wrong, but not to my taste, good variety through and the waffles are nice. Massages; he massage was very nice, they have 2 rooms so you and your partner can be massaged at the same time. The company the hotel uses is very good and I would reccomend getting one while you are there.Location; right next to metro links, bus tours, taxi ranks, retail shopping and restaurants, as well as walking distance to the beach and other attractions (if you like a stroll down the beach).Customer Service; Fantastic, every member of staff, every day, was polite, attentive and most of all reduced the language barrier to nearly nothing.

This Spanish version is the absolute most modern concept of hotel I have stayed in. The rooms were superbly designed with no loss of detail in the total concept - extreme modernity with extreme comfort. The dinning area was superbly spacious with an unbelievable lighting design that I have never seen before. The roof terrace and swimming pool were large with large open sunbathing and dinning areas and the bar there accommodated itself to all one's desires.

The hotel is so beautiful, but the staff let it down massively. I emailed the hotel in advance to let them know our arrival time on our day of check in however when we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready. We sat for three and a half hours next to the check in desk, whilst dozens of people checked in and were given their rooms. We weren't even offered a glass of water, despite travelling all morning and arriving at 12pm (the hottest part of the day). Every time we asked the staff if they knew how long the room would be, they said they simply did not know. We were told we were receiving an ocean view room, but when we arrived at the room it was simply facing a road. My boyfriend and I had arrived at the hotel after spending 5 days a Fiber Festival in Benicassim, so we were desperate to get into our room and have a shower. Instead, we were looked down upon by your staff, security guards and other hotel residents. I believe this is because we were young (I am 20 years old and my boyfriend 23) so we perhaps looked out of place compared to other residents. But to be stared at and given funny looks is very offensive. It does not matter how old we are, if we can afford to stay at your hotel, we should be treat the same as anyone else. On our second day at the hotel, we asked at the reception desk for our mini bar to be emptied so we could use the fridge ourselves for bottles of water etc, we were told it would happen that morning. When we arrived back at the hotel at 6pm, it had not been emptied, so we asked again when we left at 8pm. When we arrived back at the hotel at 12pm, it was still full. The next morning we asked for it to be emptied again. We left the hotel and came back at 5pm to find the mini bar still full. My boyfriend then rang reception for our room asking for it to be emptied and we were assured it would happen that night, however it was never emptied. We were extremely frustrated by this as it is not a difficult request. Furthermore on the fourth day, we returned to our room to find the dirty bedding the maids had took off to still be on our floor. As well as that, the price of food and drinks around the pool is almost double the price of the hotel restaurant which is absolutely ludicrous. How it can be 18 euro for a burger and chips at the pool and only 11 euro at the restaurant is beyond me, it makes no sense when it is the exact same meal. It put my boyfriend and I off from spending time around the pool, which is a shame because it is a lovely setting. Instead, we went to the beach every day which is a 25 minute walk. On the last day of our stay, which was a Saturday, we decided to spend our last afternoon next to the pool as we had been to the beach every day. At 3pm a member of staff approached my boyfriend and I and informed us that there was going to be a pool party and we had to move off our sunbeds and to a different area or leave as tables were going to be put in and non-residents of the hotel were going to be arriving. We refused, we had no prior information about a pool party. Why should we have to move for non-residents of the hotel when we are paying guests? Furthermore, there were young families staying at the hotel and they were forced to leave the pool area to make room for non-paying guests. There was a number of young children crying because they were forced out of the pool to make room for young adults in swimsuits and heels buying bottles of champagne. Melia sky is not Ocean Beach in Ibiza so I do not understand why this event occurred. The staff need to be informing guests on the day of check in that this party will be happening as it is not fair to tell them whilst they are sunbathing that they must move to make room of non-paying guests. Despite these flaws, the hotel is stunning, it is just a shame that the flaws let the experience down for us.",3,Not worth the expense,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1153245-r507313546-Melia_Barcelona_Sky-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Sally L

Although the beds were extremely hard, I would stay here again because of its location away from the crowded city center.

Couches and suspended lounge chairs can be enjoyed for free, however. Great cabana massage by Luciano.Tips: Get a business card with the hotel's address. There are two Hiltons in Barcelona, both on Diagonal Avenue. This Hilton is closer to the beach. Buy advanced tickets online before attempting to visit any tourist attraction to avoid a long queue and/or disappointment. Buy a one-day ticket for the Hop On Hop Off bus to get an overview of Barcelona. Do one route, take a siesta in the middle of the day, and then do a second route in the evening. Take taxis to attractions on subsequent days. Taxi fares usually €10 - €15 and accept credit cards Taking the Hop On Hop Off bus for transportation to see sights is extremely frustrating since busses only run in one direction and time is wasted waiting for the bus.

The pool area is very Miami Beach chic' and run by an outside company of Hilton, so watch out for hidden fees on food and beverage.An added bonus was having the Diagonal Galleria Mall just across the street (for those forgotten items that were missed in your luggage, OR anxious teenagers that needed some ""freedom"").

Though there are taxis available just outside the hotel, the cost of each trip to go to the city is between 13-20 euros and 30-40 euros to the airport. It is close enough to a beach, but the beach is very crowded and kind of dumpy, its proximity to the beach should not be the reason to choose this. It is close to a mall, which has the advantage of a supermarket and some shops if thats your purpose. Staff: Variable service. The breakfast staff was wonderful. The front desk staff were not all great. Lilliana was pleasant but not empathetic, cold, and condescending. She did not seem to care that much regarding the issues at hand and made no extra effort to accomodate us as guests. Not a people person, and not someone who should be at the front desk in my opinion. I came back after Lilliana left (maybe our issues were because it was the end of her shift and she didnt care). I spoke with Ettore - what an absolute star. He went way out of his way to accomodate us in a very full hotel trying to reorganize things to help get us into a better room - though we ultimately stayed in our original room his efforts were much appreciated. Other staff were also extremely kind and apologized for our situation. Overall: I generally only book with Hilton for as I am a gold member. Though official policy that gold members do not get access to the executive lounge unless they are on that floor, there has never been a time where I have not been extended access as a courtesy, even when the hotel is completely booked. This was probably the sole reason to book here given that with a small child it would be easier to have access to snacks, drinks, water and milk throughout the day. We were denied access, which given the policy was not a travesty, but rather an inconvenience. It is more an issue of principal. I have stayed at hiltons all over the world, and our initial experience with Lilliana left a bad taste right at the beginning of our stay in barcelona which started us off on the wrong foot. I think loyalty to the brand, should be rewarded with executive lounge access as a courtesy even though it doesnt meet official policy - its a very small gesture but goes a long way. Would I stay there again: No. Though a nice and mostly modern hotel, there are so many options in Barcelona that there is no reason to stay here with advanced planning",2,Inconvenient Location Variable Service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d559387-r502239260-Hilton_Diagonal_Mar_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,654arving

Executive lounge was fantastic, great out door terrace with plenty of Cava.Breakfast in the main restaurant was good, some servers were exceptional, others could care less.Pool was nice, although during Saturday and Sunday full of trendy people, but surprisingly there were two other families with kids.I was able to get 2 complimentary pool side sun chairs with no issue. Menu was expensive, so did not order anything. I overheard service was poor, odd since I saw dozens of servers.There is a public kids park next to hotel; Also, the Diagonal Mall in front has a very popular play area. Plenty of restaurants for kids and adults, plus a supermarket. Restaurants range from fast food, to Spanish and international. I found them very well priced and excellent wine.One block from beach; 2 blocks from subway, tram, bus, tourist bus. I prepaid private car to airport, E40 each way. Taxi is E35-E40 depending on bags, traffic, etc.Hotel is mix of business guests since it is next to convention center and plenty of tourists, since it is close to beach. Location is not ideal for first time visit to BCN, but for my family, it was great due to pool, parks, beach, mall, short taxi ride to zoo. The hotel is modern, so no local charm, but very comfortable. If you like to jog, there is a path along beach close by, you can also ride bike and rent from bike share located across mall.Bell staff was good; Lounge staff was very friendly. All staff is multilingual, great English.

On arrival the first impressions are good but that was quickly dispelled after the long wait to check in. The process was incredibly slow and this was made worse by the receptionist constantly breaking off to answer the telephone. At the end of it we were told our room was not ready and we would have to come back for the key in 30 minutes, we did and were told it still wasn't ready and to return in another 30 minutes. We had booked the hotel as part of a Jet2 package holiday so you would have thought they would have allocated us rooms that matched our flights.The reception area is really nice but the corridors are a bit tired with faded carpets. The rooms are big but a bit dated with scratched headboards and heavy gloomy curtains. They would certainly benefit from being brightened up a bit. Everything was provided that you would expect including an iron and board, safe and hairdryer. Lovely fluffy large towels and the bed was very large and comfortable. There are ice makers on each floor.The dining room was fine and the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. There was a good selection at breakfast which was fine apart from the omelettes that are cooked outside on the terrace to order and these were awful.Drinks in the hotel are very very expensive and the room service and mini bar prices are the same. I suppose this to be expected in this sort of hotel that in my opinion seems to be aimed towards business people.The location is great, just a short walk to the beach and across the road from the Diaganol Mar shopping centre where there are some good shops, a fantastic supermarket and a wide range of bars and restaurants. It is well placed for the bus routes and taxi rank. A taxi into the centre costs approximately 12 Euro.We didn't use the pool or spa but we visited one evening and it looked lovely.I must say that every time we wanted ask a question at reception we had to wait for ages. They desperately need more staff in this area.Barcelona is fantastic and there is so much to see and do we could quite happily have stayed for a week. If you want to walk into the centre it takes about an hour so make sure to wear some comfortable shoes. We walked a couple of times and you certainly see a lot of things you would miss on the bus or in a taxi.So there you are, the hotel was fine for our short break but I really can't get enthusiastic about the Hilton Diaganol Mar.

Disappointing since other hotels offer this for free to members.3. Family members were staying In room 322 and were not informed that there was going to be maintenance works going on around them resulting in them leaving the hotel to be able to relax in the afternoons4. Family members had no fridge in their room so they couldn't store the water they had purchase to keep hydrated. Again wasn't informed by hotel staff that the fridge wasn't going to be available 5. My partner and I stayed in room 701. I presume it was located next to the service elevator/store room. I kept being disturbed/woken up in the middle of the night due to sounds of trolleys crashing and doors slamming. This room is not sound proof and was not relaxing or a peaceful experience.

Location was good, near to the sea and next to a shopping centre. Also close to the train and metro stations.

We checked with reception the night before, that as we were checking out at 12 the next day and wanted to use the pool, we would we be able to shower. The receptionist said yes. Although the showers in the gym were out of order, there were showers downstairs. Perfect. We slathered ourselves in sun cream and paid for sunbeds. We all had a swim, got our hair wet and then unfortunately it was time to leave. Off we went to the downstairs showers. To our disappointment, no showers. We thought we must have got the wrong place. We went back to reception and apologised as we thought we had got it wrong. We hadn't. The receptionist the night before had got it wrong. No showers facilities. None!! We politely asked in reception if there were any other shower facilities. The answer - no. When asked what we were supposed to do, sopping wet through, full of sun cream and chlorine, about to board a flight home - change in the toilets. We even asked if we could have a room just for an hour to shower and change in. No. 'Fully booked' they said. (Upon checking their website, there were rooms available). We had to change in the toilets. Not wash our hair, not shower, but change in public toilets with other customers. We actually met another lady who was complaining about the same problem.

Puro beach is a very expensive pool club located within the hotel who charged me for 3 Moët & Chandon when I'd ordered cava and been given cava each time. I would avoid this place at all costs and instead relax by the beach. The executive lounge was nice and well appointed with lovely views. Check in was very slow & tedious and we had to move rooms late at night after being out all day as we were allocated a twin room instead of a family room. This was resolved eventually but took a lot of 'chasing up' with reception to resolve. The bar area is very nice but would I recommend this hotel to friends heading to Barcelona ?

The hotel downstairs is clean and the rooms are spacious. Puro beach is definitely the best part about the hotel!On the whole we felt that the customer service and performance was pretty poor for a 4 star hotel also considering the cost per night. The bed sheets in our room were not changed once in 6 nights. We were missing basic amenities hair dryers, bottle openers etc. And it took multiple calls to reception to obtain the items we should have already had in the room. On check out we were extremely suprised (as frequent travellers) that there was absolutely no facility for showering/changing once you had checked out. Their solution was to use the shower in puro beach (the one as you enter the pool) or to go to the toilets which are cramped and very hot. Location is quieter and is further out of the city which we preferred but if we had wanted to be central this hotel is not the one. The beach is close and the shopping mall being directly opposite was extremely handy as there are no other ""convinience shops"" and surprisingly €6 for 500ml of water at the hotel was not so appealing. Great experience of Barcelona however would think twice about returning to the Hilton diagonal mar, especially as you do not have to be a guest to go to Puro Beach. Also if this is your first visit to Barcelona be advised that beach wear is not allowed off the beach you have to be in tshirt and shorts/dress, kaftans aren't allowed.

Once you make your way to the pool area you are greeted by a sales pitch to the various packages available for your stay with varied from 20 euros for a lounger to 90 euros per person for the Puro package which I still do not have a clue what it entailed! Having decided to take up the 20 euro sun lounger for the family (60 euros lighter!) I was soon wishing I had gone to the beach which we did for the rest of our stay as we were constantly being asked if we wanted cocktail above the thumping music from the loudspeakers dotted around the whole pool area. I decided to go for a dip in the very small busy pool to be greeted by a layer of sun lotion scum in the water, clearly too small a pool to accommodate so many people and my other observation was that the toilets were located a floor down, I will leave the rest for your imagination! Needless to say I did not dip my head below the water for my one and only dip into the pool. Sadly this is were the hotel has let us down and I know a few other guests felt the same way. A real shame as the hotel itself and the location is fantastic but the lack of a clean pool and a quiet area to bath and unwind is lacking which leads me to sadly not be able to recommend this hotel unless you are after a beach resort club experience.

I'm a Hilton Honors member and one of the reasons I picked this hotel is because of the benefits that come with it....well let me just say that if this is the reason you are coming stay away. This has to be the worst service that I have ever experienced in any of the Hilton Hotels. Poor management....let me highlight some of the negatives below:1. No bellman to help you with your luggage (stayed for 4 nights and I think I saw just one randomly)2. Check in time is at 4pm, I came in at 3:30 and was told that my room wasn't ready...to come back in an hour. Came back at 4:30 really annoyed to learn that it still wasn't ready, didn't get the room till 4:45pm...they must have called housekeeping 3 or 4 times to ask if it was still cleaned? check in was poor...never got keys so had to make the line 2x....just awful. I travel a lot this has to be the worst experience3. I had a family suite....the sofa bed that my son slept in was horrible, you can feel the bar ...complained spoke to a supervisor and stated all my complaints.....he said he was going to have management call me...I never received the call. I asked him for a power adaptor and NEVER RECEIVED ONE4. Room was not adequately cleaned...rushed.5. no complimentary water6. Concierge service Leon is amazing...but only 1 person for a big hotel.....saw a number of ppl leave because the line was long including myself7. My daughter found the new toilet paper roll they had just changed dirty....Ugghh don't want to get into this.....8. On the 3rd night my husband tried to make coffee in the room to realize after boiling water that the lady had taking the coffee packets....7. staff doesn't seem to care when I addressed complaints...they almost seem use to it. I'm very surprised that this hotel has so many positive reviews. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel itself is nice..but rooms a bit rundown.....service is the worst that I have ever experienced!

Pool area does not suit for the kids family as they around half naked (topless) drunk lady dancing with a very very loud music around the pool and inside the pool with champagne. I took this with the hotel but said it was ok here in Barcelona to go topless. But what? To go topless is find but get drunk and dancing topless when there were so some kids around? That's a disgusting behavior and it's a joke that hotel stuffs did allow it.Positive about the hotel is that stuffs in executive floor are polite and friendly (not all of them but many of them) and they stuffs at pool area also polite and friendly. But the guest service (when you dial 9 from the room) are not that friendly. Don't know if it's how they talk like this in Spain or she sound just unhappy or impolite to me (the girl I talked to at 9 pm on 26/7)Back to the room. Housekeeping were polite but the forgot to put towels for us. We went for swimming and got to shower direct when we came in and found out we had no towels at all in the shower. And another thing that bothering me was one of the housekeeping knocked on the door at 8:55 and asked if wanted him to clean the room. That was very very sweet but I still wanted to sleep 8:55 am in the morning on my holiday. There were a lot of things that I want to mention but well. There were just small things so I pass for this time.Anyway like I said before. If you have kids. Don't stay in this hotel unless you want you kids have early adult experiences.,2,Not for a family with young kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d559387-r506063618-Hilton_Diagonal_Mar_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Alexander D

There's not a better location in Barcelona for gay or gay-adjacent guests.With that out of the way, I'm going to say some negatives and positives about the hotel.1) Booked online MONTHS in advance with a prepay rate. When confirmation came through, it said we had no right to cancel without losing the full amount. I went back and pretended to book again up to the final moment-- this wasn't disclosed pre-booking. I immediately wrote to the office and said, please give me a higher rate with some cancellation option. They refused! This is pretty bad customer service and a misleading website from my point of view. Either way, it was a big trip, we were getting travel insurance, we probably wanted to stay there so I went forward with it.2) I like a lot of space and so we booked one of the suites. It was lots of space but not mostly functional space. (My hunch is all the suites are kind of custom laid out: I wouldn't book one again without getting the layout of the room first. Our room: Had an exceptionally tiny sitting area; you'd never invite someone in to sit down unless you escorted them right to the outside balcony.) The hallway and ""closet"" area were unusually narrow-- we're both thin and we couldn't even pass each other in these areas. Also, the whole room had a lack of horizontal surfaces-- for toiletries, for clothing, for nightstand-type items. There's a commitment to kicky design but that becomes annoying when functionality is limited.Great things:1) Most of the staff is adorable to hot on a scale and more than helpful and speak English very well for dumb Americans like us!2) The rooftop bar is the hottest gay scene in Barcelona. Admittedly, like all bars in Barcelona, it takes WAY TOO LONG to get a drink, but the pours and generous and the rates are fair.3) Rooftop deck and pool are nice for the daytime-- a great view.4) Spa option is nice though we didn't make time to use it.5) Location is fantastic. Right in the Eixample but very close to Old Town and walkable distance to most big sights.Generally, we loved it. With a few details handled, this could become a 5-star review the next time we go.",4,You Should Definitely Stay Here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d305582-r501863919-Axel_Hotel_Barcelona_Urban_Spa-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,jblakekauai

Spotlessly clean and well appointed.My room was large, beautiful, and had great balconies. Fantastic Rain Shower glass-doored shower. Bathroom was really beautiful.Great rooftop bar and hot tub. The pool is small; but all you really need unless you're swimming laps. Great way to cool off after a long hot day in the city.The bar was crowded every night I was there. Good variety of guys too. Clearly it's a bar that Barcelonans visit as well, which is good - not just hotel guests there, so you'll meet a lot of people. Only cons:No shelf or counter space in bathrooms (and I had a Premier room)The elevators are slow and not very responsive.Frankly, the toilet paper was like sandpaper. Just being honest.The loud club music at breakfast and in the lobby in the morning is a little much, even for a gay hotel.Room service was horrid. I had a morning appointment and wanted coffee in my room while I got ready. I asked for a carafe of coffee (in 3 languages to make sure he understood - he didn't speak any English), and postponed getting ready so as not to miss room service coming to the door. 45 minutes later I called and asked where it was, and he informed me he was downstairs alone and couldn't bring it up. I told him to cancel the coffee, as I was now running late. While in the shower a housekeeper brought up one cup of coffee. She told me they don't have carafes. Why didn't the room service man tell me? And why didn't he tell me it would take an hour? Of course I was late getting to my appointment.Other than that incident, I very much enjoyed staying here.",4,Great Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d305582-r506183986-Axel_Hotel_Barcelona_Urban_Spa-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,John M

We paid a premium for a room with terrace, only discovering on our arrival that it was positioned at the end of the rooftop swimming pool area, ""screened "" from the pool users by some pot plants, which were only knee high. This meant that there was no privacy whatsoever; people passing by to the bar could look straight in; some yobs actually threw their lit cigarette ends over on to our sun beds, burning the cover; and one end was flanked by the back of the bar, where the sound of empty bottles being thrown away was a regular feature. This was very disappointing- the management quickly replaced the sunbed covers for some stained ones, which again, wasn't very nice and inappropriate for the standard of hotel. The room itself was spacious, and comfortable, with kettle and fridge. There was a large bathroom, containing separate shower and what looked like a large round spa bath in a separate area, but which turned out to be just a bath in an unlit space. Opening the window in this space was impossible, as it overlooked the sunbeds on the pool terrace. Bottled water should have been supplied daily, but we had to keep on asking for this. Breakfast was astonishing in its variety of food on offer. The breakfast hall was huge, so one had to walk a long way with plate in hand to find what was required. On our second day, we realised that we were eligible to use the ""Gourmet Corner"", adjacent, for a more intimate breakfast experience, with only a little less choice. There is also a Japanese restaurant, whose food was very good. This hotel was very expensive at around €300 per night. For this price, I would have expected more of our accommodation, and certainly a properly screened off terrace, which, in my opinion was an expensive joke. On our departure, the concierge helpfully called a taxi to take us to the airport. He had a long chat with the driver; on entering the taxi we were told that we would have to pay an extra €20 to get to the airport (to avoid traffic jams). We considered that we were ripped off here, and wonder if the concierge might be knowledgeable about this practice?",4,"Room with terrace - room OK, but terrace was a joke.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d229676-r508181758-Catalonia_Barcelona_Plaza-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Bootess

Don't use the 'hot' water provided for tea as it's not hot enough - use the hot water function on the coffee dispensers. Several restaurants - beware if you are vegetarian as eg the goat's cheese pizza 'always comes with ham' even though the menu gives no hint of this. I sent it back and it was promptly replaced but worth stating if you don't eat meat. Service in the Gourmet Corner can be slow - I didn't use the other retaurants so can't comment.

Only issue we had was the people next to us were noisy for a couple of nights so it must be thin walls.

We have stayed at other 5 star hotels and the mini bars have been full with a selection of food and drinks inside so we were a little disappointed with this one.

The bathroom was really nice, however there was only one dressing gown and one pair of complimentary slippers when they knew 2 of us were staying there. The room was cleaned and towels changed everyday, the breakfast was adequate but nothing special which we had included with our room booking, it was expensive if you had to pay extra.

After showering before a cocktail party we were attending the bathroom flooded. The flood was not from a leak but rather poor design/construction (during a shower water accumulates on the lip of the tub and because of poor design, the water travels around the tub and onto the floor, no way to prevent short of not using the shower). When we called guest services (which was difficult since none of the pre-programmed buttons worked and there was no instructions regarding hotel services) and explained the situation, a maintenance person was dispatched and quickly informed us of what we already knew. The problem was not anything he could fix because it was a construction problem. We were then moved to another room.On arrival to our second room, we found an extremely cold environment, 17 degrees Celsius, we promptly set the thermostat to 22 degrees and left for our cocktail party for which we were already late. After the cocktail party and dinner we returned to our room to find the temperature still 17 degrees despite the 22 degree setting. We promptly called guest services again (easier this time since the phone buttons worked), and were told to turn off the air-conditioning and open the windows to warm it up. That worked until it became too hot and humid at about 1:00 AM. Turned the air-conditioner back on only to have it cool to 17 instead of the 22 degrees it was set at. By this time we were exhausted and just needed to sleep prior to our departure the next morning. Miserable night.The rate for the room we booked was to include free wi-fi (which worked) and breakfast. Upon our arrival to the breakfast area we told that breakfast would cost 18-22 Euros per person despite being told at check-in that breakfast was included. Because we were tired from a poor night's sleep and had arranged a transfer to the cruise terminal already we just went around the corner and had a quick bite for half the price the hotel would have charged. Upon check out I was asked how our stay was and responded honestly saying that I was very disappointed thinking that I should have had a better experience for the price that we paid. I explained the problems that occurred, including the breakfast that I thought was included. I was told that the breakfast was included and that we should have been able to enjoy it. I was very disappointed in our experience. When I asked what could be done to make me feel better about our experience, I was told that we could go have breakfast since it was still open.",2,A disappointment at the beginning of holiday,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228512-r503548291-Renaissance_Barcelona_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,soperml

As a Platinum Lifetime Elite I have visited many Marriott Branded Hotels in my Travels. Other Renaissance Hotels stays have been perfect. There was NOTHING RIGHT about this stay with my family (3 rooms). Let's first talk about Customer courtesy at the front desk- There was none with the employee that checked us in. Nothing that we had requested and was confirmed happened. Rooms were not on the same floor- if you had planned ahead in assigning the rooms this would have happened. We were then told although our reservation confirmation said breakfast included that only 2 people would get breakfast and the other 4 would have to pay- I never get upset but the manner in witch this was told to me was shameful almost yelling at me, of course I backed away no sense in disputing this with that person. When we got to the room (again not on the same floor) the exhaust from the kitchen was blowing up in front of our window and there was a smell in the room. So they were able to move us to the same floor that one of the 3 rooms was on. Wonder why we didn't get that room to begin with? However this room had no chair to sit in but it was near the other room. The SMELL of sewer was throughout the hotel. Especially on the 4th floor and our room. The hotel said they can do nothing about it. There were just too many missteps on this stay that ruined our visit to the Beautiful City of Barcelona, Spain. Here's my suggestion:The location is perfect. If you don't care to be very disappointed (at a high cost) then stay at this hotel.If Mr. Marriott came in as the 'Undercover Boss' and had our experience this Hotel would not be a part of the Marriott Family.",1,Worst Marriott property I have stayed at- shameful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228512-r503851917-Renaissance_Barcelona_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,skidusty88

The views of Barcelona make up for the lack of proximity to most of the Barcelona attractions. That's because the hotel is nestled atop Mt Tibidabo. It overlooks Barcelona. That means you trade easy access to Barcelona hot spots for the view and some privacy.We particularly enjoyed the view over breakfast - an opulent affair spanning all the spreads: from cuts of artisanal sausage to custom made omelettes to racks of sweet buns and breakfast meats galore. I particularly enjoyed having a drink and looking at La Sagrada Familia - still imposing from a distance.The rooms themselves are very large and very comfortable. I've stayed in Parisian hotel rooms as large as the bathroom in our room in Gran Hotel La Florida. The turndown service even sets the system to play classical tunes as one gets ready for bed.

Also I would like to make it known that I very rarely review any hotel. However my experience in this case has been so extremely bad that I felt an obligation to my fellow travelers. This hotel quite frankly does not deserve the Hilton designation. When someone looks at Hilton Hotel he has trust that the franchise will guarantee a certain level of quality and service.My experience at this hotel was a total disaster from the very beginning. I arrived at the Barcelona Airport at 1 a.m. on Thursday morning and when booking this hotel of course it threw it into the next day. When I arrived I said that I would pay for Wednesday night plus the prepaid night for Thursday. They gave me a room which had no air conditioning. When I complained they told me that the minimum it could be set at was 22 . When I continued to complain they finally switched me to another room at 2 a.m. That morning I talked to the manager Mr Dalmau and was told that I would have to switch to a third room. In this room the air conditioning worked well however there was a family with several young children and infants that were screaming ,crying and running in the hallways. Despite my complaints there were no apologies only a very arrogant attitude which I have not experienced at another Hilton Hotel. I was very fortunate to find a very elegant hotel,Alma , with wonderful service just around the corner Besides being head and shoulders above the Hilton it was less expensive.",1,Not Hilton Quality ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228648-r506687529-Alexandra_Barcelona_A_DoubleTree_By_Hilton-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,milesrichard

Normally I wouldn't care so much but it was a room on the first floor facing the busy street - I had paid for a courtyard room and requested a high floor. Hilton status was not recognised. Also the reception guy just shrugged his shoulders and said sorry, that's what you've got but that they would try and more me for the next night. No compensation whatsoever was offered - eg free minibar, restaurant credit or whatever would have been appropriate. The rest if the stay was better, the restaurant staff were generally good, especially the girl who seemed to be in charge. The next day I got a much nicer guy at reception in the morning who offered by either the room I had booked on a higher floor or a suite upgrade. I took the higher floor as the suite was also street facing, but I appreciated the offer. Gym was tiny, 3 machines only. Breakfast was great.

This did not come through, which is sometimes the case, although it is rare that I don't get the paid upgrade on most stays. The manager to me the had no availability but I could call him in a day or two to check. As if I would unpack to move rooms. Sure. The hotel seemed not even close to full during our stay. It was quiet in the halls, the lobby, and the restaurant. I think they just don't want to upgrade anyone. This will deter me from staying here again. No advantage for being a diamond member means I can easily choose a different hotel. Also, there is no member lounge at this hotel but there is a complimentary breakfast for diamond members.

First, I received an email that they would not be able to accommodate their standard check-in time as the hotel was in full capacity and my room may not be ready in time. Luckily my train was arriving late to Barcelona, so that did not present an issue for this check-in. Second, upon entering my hotel room a terrible stench permeated the room. I opened the window to air out the room, but the smell would not dissipate. Third, the bathtub did not drain properly and water filled up the tub as I showered. I had arrived late to the hotel because of my delayed train, so waited until the next morning to let the front desk know about these issues. The next morning I called the front desk and asked for both items to be checked. Upon returning to the hotel in the evening, neither of those items had been fixed. My stay at the Barcelona was short, so I did not call again and mentioned it to the front desk during check-out. The person at the front desk questioned whether I had made a mistake about the room not being checked. I was extremely disappointed as a Hilton Honors member of the room and the lack of service provided.

The rooftop bar and pool were great, with a very chilled atmosphere. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, as it was quite pricey, however there is a shop opposite the hotel open 24 hours selling anything you need. The room was very clean, spacious and equipped with tea and coffee and a hot water machine. One thing I'd say is that the room was a bit dark, the window was quite small, and the lights weren't very bright. However we were not bothered by it as we didn't spend much time in the room apart from at night. The wifi is free, but like with a lot of hotels it was very slow during peak times.

The reception staff upgraded our room to a junior suite upon arrival this was situated on the 6th floor just below the pool and rooftop terrace area. The room itself was absolutely stunning, everything was fresh and contemporary and most importantly impeccably clean. Towels, robes, slippers and even a towel to take up to the pool were provided. There was also a fridge in the room which was very useful to keep items such as milk and water in. Although the bar and pool was situated directly above us this was not a problem as noise levels were minimal. The only thing I would say about the room is there wasn't a view, only a wall to look out on, again this didn't prove to be a problem as the view from the roof terrace is amazing - you can even see the impressive W Hotel and sea views in the distance. We had breakfast and a couple of evening meals at the hotel and they were delicious and in comparison to restaurant prices around Barcelona very reasonable. As for the drinks there is a good selection of cocktails and of course, Sangria!! I visited with my Mum and she would highly recommend the Mojito Sin for a refreshing drink at the end of a day exploring the city.This was the first time either of us had visited the city so it took us a while to get our bearings... a good tip that we found is that the Passeig de Gracia Metro station to be the most conveinent stop, within 5 min walking distance from the hotel, to get us to popular tourist spots. We made use of this to get us to the beach at Barcelonetta, La Rambla and the Sagrada Familia. A short stroll in the opposite direction of the hotel will take you to the impressive Arc de Triomff.A trip that we would recommend taking via a cab is to Park Guell, it is a bit of an uphill walk but a taxi will take you directly to the entrance. From the hotel this is about a 20min ride away but is well worth it for the impressive Gaudi architecture and the breathtaking views. Another trip we would recommend via cab is to/from the airport which we found to be about half hour away in rush hour traffic. Thank you so much to all the staff at the Silken Gran Hotel Havana for being so welcoming and for making our first time in Barcelona so enjoyable, we have already started recommending you to our friends and family and will certainly be back!",5,"Great stay, in a beautiful hotel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d208209-r504443935-Silken_Gran_Hotel_Havana-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,rachael91_11

You could sense the atmosphere amongst the staff. Now, I booked a two night stay for four people some time ago. They charged me €680 for the privilege. On 15th May I asked if there was any chance I could have a 12pm - 1pm check in instead of the normal 3pm. They duly came back and said it shouldn't be a problem but they would see how things were on the day. I arrived at 9am from a cruise and spent the next six hours waiting on my room. All with young children. They kept saying ""come back in 20 minutes"" every time we asked, which was after 1pm and got all stroppy every time we did. I accept that there is a 3pm check in. Just say that an early check in is not possible. Better still, and I said this to reception, why not ask housekeeping if they could make a family room a priority as there was a family with young children waiting. All the while, guests were arriving and getting their rooms early. Nobody told me that the bar was a building site, banging and crashing all day and dust everywhere. I wouldn't have booked if I had known. They also saw fit to remove my spare room key that I had the audacity to leave in the room to leave the air con on. Shame on me, so they just left me with one key. The final straw, so far anyway as I am still in my room as I write this. I asked if reception could book me a taxi to the airport, big enough for four people and luggage. They said they couldn't because there is a taxi rank outside! Why can't they? And very rude they were, as I say in the title. Contemptuous. Very poor value for money.On the plus side, when I checked out in the morning, the reception guy was very helpful without being asked. He even came outside and made sure I got the right size of taxi. That's more like what I expect for €350 per night without breakfast!",2,Contemptuous!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d623246-r502186745-Catalonia_Ramblas-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Anthony B

Just about a block away from Placa de Catalunya, it was a great home base for getting around Barcelona. The bathroom in our hotel room was really outstanding in terms of the design and quality of the fixtures. The bedroom was just okay. It was clean, but a little drab in its decor. I felt as if the modern and updated bathroom was a mismatch for the classic but still comfortable room. Unfortunately we had no view, or sunlight which made the room seem even more dull. Luckily we spent most of our time enjoying the city, including views of the city from the rooftop bar and pool at Avenida Palace. Be sure to check it out. So all in all, I had a perfectly adequate 3-night stay in this hotel, however when I return to Barcelona I think I will be looking for a slightly more stylish and luxurious accommodations.

It is in a great location easy walking distance to many tourist attractions and the tour buses stop just round the corner. The hotel itself seems nice and the rooftop bar is lovely, we enjoyed sitting up there and seeing the views at night.However the rooms really do vary so be warned, we were given one of the central facing rooms which overlooks an internal courtyard area, i.e no view whatsoever. We asked to swap but were given short shrift from the unhelpful receptionist and told no other rooms were available that weekend. Our rooms was clean and the bathroom was modern with toiletries. However the lack of a view was disappointing and as we were on the first floor at the bottom of this central courtyard/lightwell there was no natural light in the room at all. Every morning felt like the middle of the night. I work in a prison and kid you not the room reminded me of a prison cell in terms of lack of light (although not lack of space). Please take this into account, we cut our trip short and stayed just 3 nights instead (although this was partly due to not enjoying Barcelona in general at this time of year) I certainly would not want to stay an extended period of time in this hotel.The only positive was our room was very quiet at night whereas I imagine rooms facing the street are noisier.We were still charged for 4 nights though and over the price quoted when booked. We just wanted to leave asap and couldn't face challenging the staff over this though. The one positive staff member was the porter who ordered us a taxi without being asked and helped with our luggage so it was nice to end on a positive.We had the continental breakfast one day, the food was good but not work the money they charge for it.Overall I could not say we 'enjoyed' our stay as such but this may be partly to not enjoying a very busy Barcelona (our fault for booking in July!) we have enjoyed it much more at different times of year. Also I would advise avoiding Las Ramblas completely at night we were approached by over 20 different men offering us drugs and witnessed many common scams and people's bags being slashed open by pickpockets on our first night. Go else where in the city to enjoy the nightlife.",3,Hotel ok but rooms a bit of a lucky dip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d206936-r506186258-Hotel_El_Avenida_Palace-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Moonshine25

The hotel was very beautiful and from the outside very well kept. We are a family of four so went with the family room which essentially is paying for two rooms. Our nightly fee was €660. For this price we had high expectations. Once in our room, we noticed a horrible smell coming from the vents that was definitely something deceased in the ceiling. We immediately alerted the front desk and nothing was done. Therefore, all four of us slept in one of the rooms as our kids didn't sleep in the other because of the smell. The next morning I went down to talk to the front desk; I was told there were no rooms available to move into. Therefore, I booked a room at the Fairmont for 1/3 the price of this hotel. Upon check out, they magically said let me talk to the manager. The manager was very kind and went and acknowledged the state and smell of the room. He did offer us an upgraded room but by that time it was too late as we had already booked a different room at the Fairmont; being told previously told there were no other rooms available. We were not offered any type of discount and paid full price for the night we stayed even though we only used one of the two rooms. We are currently now at the Fairmont and couldn't be happier, as the accommodations here are excellent. It is on the outside of the city and not as convenient as being in the center of things, but a cab ride is very little to pay for a good nights sleep in this exciting city. Despite the bad smell in the room, the beds are very uncomfortable in the family rooms and not a comparison to any of the major hotels in the US; such as the Westin, Fairmont, Marriott, Hilton, or even the holiday inn express. I don't write too many bad reviews but I just feel that I must share this one.",1,Trouble in the Middle!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d206936-r505591517-Hotel_El_Avenida_Palace-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Gregory B

Taxis are not easy to catch on the street, though we saw a couple parked just outside of the hotel. As to our stay, we stayed for 2 nights and were pretty happy. Checkin and checkout were easy, the front office staff is very nice and helpful. The room's size was ok, for two adults. Breakfast was fresh and very good choice. The manager and waiting staff were welcoming and helpful. Parking is available around the corner , but over-weekend you could park on the street even on the bus/tax lane (this was what we did).

Unfortunately the hotel was accommodating a lot of Chinese groups, which were taking over the restaurant during breakfast (they were even using coffee machines to water their instant noodle soups (the smell was awfull)). The staff wasn't capable of turning the tables fast enough, and the restaurant was really crowded. Housekeeping was also not doing its job - just after check-in we have found empty bottles in the bathroom (shower gel etc.), the sheets were never changed, although we stayed for 8 days, and the floor - well, enough to say I had to clean it myself because noone else did.",3,Could be better,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d254869-r505240919-Four_Points_by_Sheraton_Barcelona_Diagonal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Mariusz L

Me and my family had to take turns going up! Being a platinum SPG member, they upgraded us or so they say. But the upgrade is the same type of room and just 2 floors higher. I needed some ice at one point and called the front desk if there are any ice dispensers -- which is typical of four point hotels. But was told I need to go down to the bar/restaurant to get it myself or they will charge a service fee if I want it brought up to the room. The shower is so narrow that you need to be careful that you do not hit your elbows.There was a situation where the people handling the breakfast table in the morning was getting fed up with the tour group from China who could not speak or understand English - remarking that English is important.

The rooms on the 9th floor are big and have a roomy, nice looking marble bathrooms with a great jacuzzi tub. Also the room has nice amenities like coffee, tea and water. That said,a night on their mattresses is not much better than sleeping on the floor (and I like hard mattresses, but this is ridiculous). And, of course, the rooms are noisy - it has been a long time since I could hear the folks in the adjoining rooms. There is no service to speak of - no bellhop to take you bags into the hotel and up to your room (we arrived at 8 p.m. and the doorman leaves in the afternoon), two hours (literally, and only after two irritating calls) to get someone to bring you a remote which works and they can't call you a cab (and there is no doorman). I was told that in Spain they cannot call you a cab if there is a taxi stand close by (really, with 50% unemployment of young people???), even though there are no taxis at the taxi stand. And this neighborhood is a $14 cab ride (one way) to the main boulevard and not one you would want to walk in (graffiti covers everything and with unemployment the way it is, there are young men standing about everywhere). Lastly, the bartender's idea of a martini was to put some vodka in a glass over ice and, then, when I explained I wanted it ""up"" (and told him ""no ice""), he put the warm vodka in a glass and handed it to me.

I cant believe how some people can be so damn rude and lack so much common sense!This is a lovely hotel, yes its main purpose is being a business hotel but familys are still welcome. Ive stayed in a few business hotels now, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them, just some peoples expectations are not realistic. We stayed here for a week while exploring & relaxing in barcelona and i wouldnt have picked anywhere else to stay. Stylish hotel throughout, friendly staff (regardless of previous comments) and lovely breakfast. We specifically didnt eat dinner here because of previous reviews and to be honest was glad as the downstairs restaurant is under renovation at the moment, so they obviously cannot offer the full service they would like too. Although i would like to point out that absolutely nothing could fault the breakfast service. Huge array of choice, cooked, cold, cereal, fruit, breads.. how anyone could nit pick and find fault with that i have no idea.We had the first flight out of heathrow @ 6.15am so arrived at the hotel around 10.30am, even though check in isnt supposed to open until 2, our room was already ready for us to get comfortable and un-pack. Yeah okay the beds arent the softest in the world, but if they were soft im pretty sure someone would complain that they werent hard. After a couple of nights sleep you get used to it like a human, plus actually exploring barcelona makes you too tired to even care!The hotel itself is in a great location, 1 block away from the metro (which we used alot!) and only about 10 minute walk from the beach & restaurants at the port olympic. Everything is easy to get too, and it is not a scary neighbourhood which people have tried to put it out to be. Its a residential area and you barely see another soul walking around after 10pm. Only small downfall i must say would be the rooftop pool. As much as we loved it once we had beds, it just wasnt big enough or had enough room for everyone. But then you have to remind yourself that it is after all a business hotel catering for families etc, so its not going to be like the resort you would find on the costa del sol. We got up @ 9am to get beds and stayed there till about 3 on only 1 day of our trip, this being a sunday was an extremely busy day. It is alot busier from friday - sunday due to weekend travellers but its no big problem at all. Overall i would recommend this hotel & the chain (as their other hotels elsewhere are incredible) to people who know what their expecting and are not miserable human beings.

There is a pool on the top floor but it is quite small, there is a fair few sun beds and chairs there but they get taken very quickly, and you are sitting on top of one another, but it is good for a couple of hours rest after a hard day exploring. The reception staff were really helpful, we needed directions to a few things we had booked and they made sure we knew what tubes to catch and the exact directions. The area surrounding the hotel is more local and residential but we felt really safe walking about late at night and stopping off at some of the more local bars where you are not ripped off for a drink or meal as you are in the more touristy areas in the central area of Barcelona, we went there in the day and returned in the evening for a less busy evening.

My teenage daughter and I had a basic twin room on the 2nd floor. I asked for a quiet room (i.e. away from the bar and rooftop pool) and away from the lift, which I was given. As in any city-based hotel, earplugs were useful. The cleaners arrived early and were noisy than the norm. The pool is on the 8th floor. It's superb! After sightseeing it was a quiet, sunny haven to get a cocktail and some chill. It got a little busy at times but there was always a seat available, even if there weren't any loungers left. My only criticism is that smoking is allowed which seems a bit dated in an area where there's drink/food/children. Perhaps smoking should just be around the bar and not the pool. The room/bathroom itself were a little weary but the shower was powerful; pillows comfy; bed was clean, so all good! The staff were all lovely and helpful, particularly the bar/waiting staff on the ground floor. It's a 10/12 min walk to the beaches, which again, were superb. La Rambla and Casa Bastilo would be a bit too much to walk (I think!) so we hopped in a taxi -there are taxis to the left of the hotel- and then walked back. €10 ish.

Banks/ATM's/Supermarkets 2 minutes' walk away.The Front Desk Staff were awesome and always ready/available to assist. Checking in and out was a breeze and absolutely no problem/hassle at all.The Staff in the Restaurant in the Evening were very kind/helpful/attentive and the food quality was very good.Breakfast Buffet was fine, good choice of coffees/beverages and the options for which type of breakfast were wide.The Junior Suite has a large bathroom and the bed was comfortable.The Negatives:Sadly, there are a couple of things that really let the hotel down and would in our opinion, be pretty easy to solve.The Junior Suites are on all floors, the first Suite and not ideally placed next to the Housekeeping Room - so there is a lot of noise from the Housekeeping door being opened/closed and the Room Attendants and their associated noise/chatter.Our Room attendants failed badly on the second/third night (First night we opted just for change of towels). But nights 2 & 3 the room was not cleaned properly, mini-bar not replaced, toiletries not replaced, all round a shoddy/rushed job (not once but twice). After we complained to Front Desk things were fine - but the staff on Housekeeping those two days badly let the hotel down - just simple laziness.The second problem is that Wi-Fi, whilst free throughout, is not stable at all and not only keeps dropping, but can remain down for long periods of time. If you do find that you are the type of person that needs to work whilst travelling, this can be a major interruption.But solve the 2 problems above and you have a very good, pleasant experience and even without a Gym or Pool, you would have a good stay if only those 2 issues could be resolved.",4,Great Location and Great Front Desk Staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d285755-r501768583-Vincci_Maritimo_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,AdrianShanghai

The lounge attendant called for the keys and a grumpy older gentleman came to unlock the fridges but not before complaining about how those fridges were locked at a certain time and then open much later.

When arrived no one assisted us with the luggage, wanted to check in at the Ex Lounge, told can't and should check in the arrival counter. The staff was rude, not polite and when requested for a upgrade to a suite was told non available, Lousy executive lounge (someone sleeping in the lounge like a homeless person during day time and the staff was totally unaware). The breakfast at the lobby was the worst that I ever experienced (ate only one day). I was promised to a Junior suite on the 2nd night but the staff was not aware fully what's going on. However I got the upgrade on the 3rd night but the quality of the suite was not worth mentioning. The room amenities were minimum (i set of toiletries for 2 guests, no mouth wash). Reluctant to provide extra drinking water. When I asked to show the written benefits that the hotel provides to diamond member, none was available. The duty manager said she will send one to the room but never done. When I changed rooms, no one assisted us to move, my wife got a trolley herself and we arranged moving rooms ourselves.The hotel ambiance is not suitable for a Hilton hotel and more like a 3 star hotel.

There are two Hiltons in Barcelona, both on Diagonal Avenue. This Hilton is closer to the beach. Buy advanced tickets online before attempting to visit any tourist attraction to avoid a long queue and/or disappointment. Buy a one-day ticket for the Hop On Hop Off bus to get an overview of Barcelona. Do one route, take a siesta in the middle of the day, and then do a second route in the evening. Take taxis to attractions on subsequent days. Taxi fares usually €10 - €15 and accept credit cards Taking the Hop On Hop Off bus for transportation to see sights is extremely frustrating since busses only run in one direction and time is wasted waiting for the bus.

They sent us a bottle of cava like 2 seconds after we walked in the room, nice gesture but give us some time. now to the crazy part! So after having a rushed glass of cava my girlfriend went to get changed in the bathroom and closed the door behind here.Then the door didn't open, i tried and tried and the handle was not working, tried looking for the number of reception to call someone but no luck, so i headed down stairs and told them, the looked very relaxed about it and told me to go back up and the maintenance guy will be there to help. So i did. and indeed the guy turned up. speaking to my girlfriend she was now feeling the heat in a closed space and very unconformable, the maintenance guy tried and tried to open the door but no luck, after bringing his tools he managed to take the whole lock out and finally after 30 mins he opened the door. We opted to leave the room while he went to find and new door handle to fix, The disappointing bit is that when we came down to reception they really didn't care what had just happened i mean imagine someone was on their own in there! Anyways we didn't take second chances of trying to close the bathroom door again! Sleeping at night again uncomfortable pillows and the air conditioning only send cold air straight to the bed so we couldn't keep it on at night.

They keep the public areas spotless. However there are some things you need to know. The restaurant is quite expensive. I elected to not have any meals there at all. There are so many options close to the hotel. Another thing you need to know is that they block the elevator from going to where the spa/Jacuzzi is located, until 10AM. It is not a pool, but a large jacuzzi, that is kept very clean and it is refreshing, but it is shallow. In addition, there were several times that they had not opened it until i called them myself to remind them to unlock it for guests to use. Why is that? This was at 10:15AM. Plus, there is an additional code on a keypad you have to enter, which is fine, but they changed the code during my stay, and i was not aware of that, because they had not informed me and they said they would have the maintenance look at it. Well, the staff person didn't even know that the code had changed themselves. That wasted a day for me. Not fun. The wi-fi in my room was not good, either. Bummer. The A/C finally was fixed after 2 days of complaining about it. My key malfunctioned 3 times over 3 days and they finally issued me a new one, but not until i really pressed them. OK, so why would i return? Because of the staff, like ""Victor"" who was excellent, and ""Raquel"" who is concierge. She personally got out , into the city to help me find some special requests that needed a native speaker. I will forever appreciate her personal help.

We'd chosen a Cathedral view room and I'd really recommend spending that little extra to do the same. Was a beautiful view to wake up to and listening to the bells was wonderful. The reception staff were all very helpful and so friendly and knowledgeable in all the places to visit. We had booked for breakfast and really enjoyed the selection of hot and cold food.

We were offered a glass of bubbly on arrival, and complimentary drinks were available from 12-4pm daily. Our room was lovely and the complimentary toiletries were of a very high standard. Service was excellent, the staff on reception were always very friendly and helpful. Great value for money. My only slightly negative comment is that it can get noisy throughout the night due to the rooms overlooking a central courtyard above reception, and any noise in the reception travels up to the rooms. This was easily resolved when a kind member of staff advised where I could buy some earplugs from! I can't believe this was a three star hotel, it felt far more like a four-star hotel.

We requested to be moved from first room as it was so small. No washclothes. Great location as bus stop is across street and you are at the top of La Rambla(walking area with shops and restaurants). Lots of high end stores, like 5th Avenue in NY. Also, very busy this time of year and warm weather. NO public bathrooms, you either use a McDonalds or some restaurants require you to buy something to use the toilet. Eating outside was crowded,(and everyone smokes) but inside where they had air conditioning was less people. Make reservations before you go online if you want to see the major attractions. ( We took a 45 minute train ride to see the champagne caves and couldn't get a tour as they were all booked. )Train and bus service were easy to use. ITAPA next to hotel was not very good food. However, La Tagliatella was an excellent Italian restaurant, as was Bars & Bar. Everyone eats late, 9 to 10 at night, so if you go earlier, you can get right in.

The shower was my favourite part of the room, absolutely massive. The air con was good. Shame that there was no complementary water/drinks in the room especially as you are not really meant to drink the tap water (especially when occasionally it looked brown) There is a supermarket across the road, but still not quite the same when you have travelled and need a drink. It was different staying in a bakery, everything looked amazing however we found that the bakery staff were very rude and unhelpful. It was hard to order especially as there were no signs as to what anything was. All other bakery's we went into had signs and menus on the wall. The staff put us off attempting to order there, the lady who served us rolled her eyes and scoffed at us which made me feel very uncomfortable on our first day!! Instead from then on we had breakfast in the hotel which was nice, everything was pastries, bread or cheese and ham etc. Bit basic I would say for 9 euro but did the job.

The location was perfect, great breakfast and cozy rooms. For improvement purposes, I'd like to focus on some things that could have been better. Starting with the service and employees, they were friendly and helpful when we asked for help, also that it was staff there 24/7. We got the feeling that it was a lot of staff working there, but only one for the hotel part and the rest for the bakery. So it was not so much of personal contact, which often is appreciated. Just to have someone at the hotel help the tourists that's staying there with things that can improve the whole vacation to Barcelona by guiding to restaurants, public transportation, sightseeing and other things.For the beds, they had some extra madress, that was awful to sleep on, so during the last few days, I had to take that off the bed to get some sleep.The cleaners did a good job to make it tidy every day, though one simple thing to improve the stay would to have toilet brushes to stay in the bathroom, so we can keep the bathrooms clean ourselfs, which would have improved our stay.The bread that was served for breakfast was delicious, though it would be appreciated to have some more yoghurt, cerials etc. and more things to put on the bread and eat. Also the logistics for where the glasses, plates, bread, toaster, and drinks are placed is not optimal and would be better to be switched a bit. ex. not to have the glasses and juices on opposite sides of the breakfast table.Except for these small improvement possibilities, we had a good stay and would come back to this hotel if we're back in Barcelona.",4,Very cozy hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d5790522-r506516052-Hotel_Praktik_Bakery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,TuristensKlagande

The GM, Raul, has created a superior team and over-the-top guest experience. Elena coordinated every detail of our travel arrangements and gave us lot of ideas before we even arrived to help us plan. They were wonderful and made this trip so perfect for us. We stayed at club level at the Hotel Arts (a Ritz hotel), and it was definitely worth the extra cost. For starters the Club Lounge offers panoramic view of the city and relaxing environment that lets you take in the city and beach while being catered to like royalty. It is open first thing in the morning until midnight and is staffed with concierge to help with reservations, answer questions about the city, make a cappuccino, keep the amazing endless buffet of food fresh and stocked... There is everything you could want to drink from sparkling water to juices to tea/coffee, champaign, wine, and mixed drinks. While out an about we would swing by the Club for a quick glass of wine or coffee and get some small plates. It made our trip more affordable and so easy. It was also nice to have a quieter place to get a way from the city for an afternoon break. Every morning I started my day running on the pedestrian path by the beach. You can easily get a good five mile run in along the beach. The bellman were so awesome to recognize me upon leaving and returning, greeting me by name, and quick to offer me a bottle of water upon my return. You can tell the staff there are happy, well-trained in all aspects of their jobs, and really enjoy working at the Hotel Arts. After my run we'd get breakfast at the Club, make reservations, and plan our day. The concierge staff working in the Club and in the main lobby are amazing. They managed to get us premium reservations in places booked out for well over a year (like the 4 star Michelin restaurant, Lasarte, which I'm reviewing next... an over-the-top amazing experience for foodies) and local spots that we'd never have found without their help.Barcelona itself is a dynamic, vibrant tourist destination. We heard rumors that in summer it is over-crowded to the point that you can't see the sand on the beach when looking down from the top floors of the hotel. We also heard that in the The Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic) that the night life can be rough with aggressive prostitutes and pick-pockets. We didn't experience that, but we went in March and our evenings were spent exploring the fine cuisine and gastronomy. When we did venture out to The Gothic Quarter we were extra vigilant and careful. We had no issues whatsoever. I'll be adding reviews of the wide variety of restaurants we dined at and some of our favorite sites to see (The Market, Gaudi sites, the Black Madonna). We spent ten days exploring Barcelona and still have more on our list of sites to see for future trips. We will definitely be back to Barcelona and will stay again at the Hotel Arts!",5,Incredible place to stay in Barcelona ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d190635-r501689664-Hotel_Arts_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,JenLovesSunshine

My biggest 'moan' however, would have to be about the breakfast which I thought was very average. Also, after ordering cooked to order eggs and bacon, our plates were left on the side waiting to be brought to us for at least five minutes and were uncovered with two waitresses talking to each other directly over them. I suppose I should have asked for them to be cooked again (as they were cold when they got to us) but, as were in a hurry, we didn't.

Rooms are ""classy refined"" with either city views, ocean views , or some corner rooms which have views of both. I must single out bellhop David Alster who was really great. Breakfast is excellent, with a great selection. Only disappointments were 1) pool (though nice) is small for a hotel of this size, 2) even though the hotel is on the beach it does not have its own private beach, and 3) (a personal pet peeve) was charged €20 for one serving of ice cream with three scoops. Though I expect high prices at a hotel, (and they did adjust it at check out), that was exorbitant. I definitely recommend this hotel for anybody going to Barcelona . One last thing, we checked out the W Hotel while there, as we were curious, as we debated staying there, and we definitely recommend Hotel Arts over the W Hotel.

The public reception served champagne. The service everywhere is impeccable although it seemed like every employee I encountered had started work in the last 2 weeks to 3 months. Thus, there were many mistakes with their answers to my questions. Yes, even at the club level. I had little confidence in our club concierge who had begun work 2 weeks ago as she did not know about a couple attractions and gave us some incorrect information which frustrated us and cost us time. The club itself is lovely with a fabulous view and delicious food as well as drink. Our room on the 30th floor had a view of the sea and the city. We loved the size of the room as well; as the appointments. The rooms were large and the storage plentiful in European standards.

Probably the latter. If you want a poolside chair, then hustle up early in the morning to claim your stake or get your name put on a waiting list for a chair. But wait, you can be on the waiting list (after you've been escorted to sit in the grass some 250 yards away and down a flight of steps) and still have someone show up after you only to demand seating and be immediately accommodated. The pool staff doesn't actually check with one another before offering a poolside chair so you have to speak with the right person or you sit in the grass with a view of the baby pool. Absolutely dreadful organization. This ""waiting list"" situation occurred not once, but 2 out of the 3 days we went to the pool. Consider the W Barcelona or the Mandarin Oriental if you want sophistication and relaxation.As for the cleaning of the rooms, do not anticipate that your room will be cleaned before 4:00 pm if the hotel is busy. After 4:00 you can expect several phone calls asking when it would be convenient for the room to be serviced. Since we were out of the room from 10:00 am to 4:30 pm, most days, it would have been convenient during that time. Unfortunately they got around to our room at 5:00 pm when we were freshening up from being out all day, then wanted to know when we'd be leaving... really???The saving grace of this hotel are the restaurants - which are absolutely excellent. The quality of the food, the service, the enthusiasm for the wines available are world class. Each venue is wonderful in its own way. The dining made up for a multitude of aggravations over the course of 5 days.Overall a great place for families, particularly with young children (read: not for couples / adults /romance). Also great for foodies and those who appreciate being in the company of Arabic counterparts as the hotel caters significantly to both. Avoid this hotel if you want sophistication, relaxation, have an expectation of consistency (whether pool availability or room cleaning), or if you don't enjoy the smell of stale cigarette smoke in your room/towels/sheets.",3,Horrible Pool - Stay elsewhere if you want relaxation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d190635-r506494348-Hotel_Arts_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,dgh17

We’re Ritz-Carlton Platinum and were upgraded to a higher floor (facing the city / beach), which was appreciated. Decided against the club level upgrade since we’d be touring most of the day.In general, the hotel is beautiful but falls a little bit short of U.S. Ritz-Carlton standards. The bathrooms were lovely, sitting / bed area plenty spacious, but somewhat sparsely decorated. Definitely appreciated the well-functioning black-out shades as we were a little jet-lagged. The hotel staff was wonderful and couldn’t have been more helpful. The folks at the check-in desk were great, the concierge was very helpful, and the complimentary champagne / cold water in the lobby is always appreciated! The main issue we had with the hotel is the location. It’s located on the beach, and is far from the old town / tourist attractions. Sure, you get access to the beach, but most ppl don’t come to Barcelona for beaches. And then there’s the issue of foot traffic from the cruise ships, which isn’t always the most pleasant. We found ourselves spending a significant amount of time in transit between the hotel and other parts of town, when it would have just been easier to stay elsewhere. Overall, a perfectly lovely hotel, but be aware of its locations with regards to what you want to do, and the extra time you may need to allot for transiting between the hotel and the main tourist attractions of the city.",4,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, alright location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d190635-r502951139-Hotel_Arts_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,peter3267

While free nights were used to stay here I still believe this hotel should be held to Ritz Carlton standards. As for location, I would not stay again in this area - though if you enjoy crowded beaches and long treks, this is your spot! Personally Gracia seemed to have less tourists with far better cuisine and shopping. Also am not sure why this is called the hotel arts as it's not particularly aesthetic (Gehry aside) nor is there one piece of art on the wall in our room. We were given a ""better"" room because of gold status but cannot imagine how it was different than a regular room - upsides were early check in and a partial city/ocean view. Overall the accommodations were fine yet tired - comfortable bed, generous bathroom and good housekeeping service. The hotel itself is massive and the staff is more than friendly. Some of the facilities such as the pool just aren't able to handle as many guests. Poolside drinks are $30 for a pair and take as many minutes (an exception to the rest of the city).

Previous reviews are totally correct. This hotel needs to invest some of its income on new carpets and a deep clean of the sofa's! The decor is fine actually, typically RC and there are some nice touches such as sweets for the children. The pool area is a joke and not in a good way. Far too small and unless you get up to save beds at 8am (which I was forced to do having had nowhere to sit on the first day) you can forget about finding anywhere to sit. It was only because the sea was too dirty to let the children swim and beaches no better that we put up with the hotel pool but it's such a shame the hotel doesn't spend some money on improving this situation. There is the space for a separate club level pool in the garden areas.Everything was very expensive but I don't mind this as it keeps certain clientele at bay... I have been to more 'affordable' Ritz Carlton hotels before and it totally ruins the experience. At least most fellow guests did have a bit of class and knew how to behave. The hotel overall (or rather the club lounge/floor) rescued our trip after the disappointment of the beach and we were very impressed at the consistency of staff. Whoever is responsible from the training of the staff is doing a super job overall (although it did take 45 minutes to get a drink by the pool one time). I have rarely come across such excellent customer service and consistency of approach. On the club floor nothing is too much trouble and anything is possible. It really is impressive.

But the truth is that this Hotel gives off the air of a business hotel and a conference centre, with no soul or atmosphere. If you are a family don't go here - stay at the W. There was a queue(!!) for the lifts, and the staff did not even use their own elevator but instead used the guest lift!! Not very useful when there is a queue and nobody can get a lift-the paying customers should get priority I think??The swimming pool was as small as a fish tank. The water was as cold as the atmosphere - for a hotel with 40 floors surely there should have been a greater amount of space dedicated to a leisure area?? Furthermore - there were no changing rooms on the pool level - disappointing for a five star hotel. On the contrary when we visited the W hotel - which was cheaper (!) -we saw it had multiple panoramic pools, large and spacious enough for a luxury hotel.The food was another problem. Our first meal at the pool bar cost us upwards of 150 euros for a family of 4! The pizza was ridiculously overpriced for an oily piece of bread that would have costed 3 euros at max to make - but was sold at over 20 euros!! Just because this is a 'luxury' hotel doesn't give you a licence to rip customers off. At the W where we ended up eating in nearly every night; there was a beautiful terrace with multiple restaurants by the beach serving tasty food which wasn't horrendously priced.Credit where credit is due, a positive for the hotel arts was that the breakfast was very tasty. Plenty of choice and great quality - the spread was very good and it exceeded my expectations.The rooms were a bit outdated but the rain shower was excellent and the views were nice. The service was fine - everyone was very pleasant but when coming to deal with certain pressing issues we had, the front desk failed to respond or get back to us on time. In conclusion, this was just underwhelming. If you want to come here as a family, you will be stuck with nothing to do inside! Although it is 'close' to the city centre, so are most of the other good hotels; and this hotel simply seemed like a business facility. It isn't a hotel that wowed me or blew me away at all.",2,NOT a family resort - more like a business hotel.

We were told that if we left our spot for 30 minutes our beds would be given to someone else and our belongings removed so we couldn't even leave our beds to have lunch.

While I'm generally not one for self-segregating into gay locations for vacations etc., I have understood the appeal of a gay-aimed hotel. There have been a few instances in my life where traveling with a same sex companion raised eyebrows (""you just want one bed?!"") or bringing a gentleman back to a room for the night was an issue. I've stayed at the Axel property in Berlin and there was something nice (if a bit quaint) about just being around my queer bros there. So, that's not a bad thing.However, TwoHotel, either by initial design or reorientation (ahem), is not that. From the proliferation of reviews here saying ""we didn't know it was a gay themed hotel but liked it anyway"" my guess is the gay theme didn't pay off at first, and they have marketed it around Europe as a fashionable discount location. Which in fact, it is. And I must say the idea of a little sheen of gay-fabulousness as just a tourist atractiion, not as a rule for entry, is kind of appealing as we queers become more and more accepted. And so, this place seemed to be about 20% gay dudes as far as I could tell, and honestly I realized pretty quickly I couldn't tell, and it really didn't matter. I stayed during a major event at FIRA, a convention center just down the street, and while other nearby hotels were charging 200 euros/night and up, TWO was still affordable. Its location is pretty perfect for Barcelona--not trapped in the overwhelming tourist and party zone of the center, but still central, perfectly located for transit, and just a 20 euro taxi to the airport. The hotel itself is charmingly designed, with a few quirks and silly decorations that were varyingly successful. The lobby does have its nude male portraits and pink/white decor, but the rooms are understated and modern. Negatives: beds are hard as rocks, bathrooms sacrifice convenience for style, toilet is not very private (not an issue for this single traveler but a new couple might feel uncomfortable). But I never heard a peep from halls or nearby rooms, which is HYUGE. Plus, air conditioning during a stifling heat wave was good, and the rain-head shower a delight. Up on the roof is the real bonus. It's a cute, fake-grass and pink chair lounge area. Every day I'd get up and head upstairs for a stretch, some sun, and jump in what is basically a ""splash"" pool to cool off, and gaze out at the apartments across the street and marvel to myself at my good luck. Then I'd order a fancy gin and tonic and feel even better. The rooftop was never overcrowded and was a lovely way to meet guests from all over the world, couples from France and Russia, a group of hilarious bros from the UK. Also, straight American dudes: girls totally took their tops off up there. The little gym on the roof is barely a gym, but has a pulley machine and a bench for some basics. I prepaid for breakfast and then was so busy and late to bed I missed it all but 2 of my 7 mornings. But it was varied and good quality those two happy mornings.So again, gay dudes looking for an exclusively gay experience, I don't judge you for wanting that sometimes, I get it. But TWO is just a good stylish bargain in a great location, and feels much more in the spirit of inclusion and celebration of Barcelona. Get comfier mattresses and I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,"Not that gay, and better for it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7806223-r503670752-TWO_Hotel_Barcelona_by_Axel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,SFGuyDoinStuff

We aren’t really the party type and weren’t really sure what to expect. We were apprehensive, to say the least. I can absolutely recommend this hotel without hesitation. In fact, we can’t think of anywhere else we would rather stay when visiting Barcelona. The staff were extremely kind and helpful. Special shout-out to Jaime, who has an excellent sense of humor (I’m a sucker for jokes). They upgraded our room upon check-in, so we had a nice balcony overlooking the street. This was much appreciated. The facilities were modern and clean. We really enjoyed the rooftop pool in the afternoons when it was entirely too hot to walk (or generally move) around the city. Drinks are expensive up there, but it’s expected that you pay for the convenience. FYI – you have the option to pay at the bar and not charge the drink to your room. We liked this, since we didn’t incur a huge check-out charge. There’s also a nice little community park behind the hotel with plenty of places to sit and relax. We enjoyed purveying neighborhood life here. The hotel is located a bit outside of main tourist zones, but we liked that it felt more like a local neighborhood. There’s a metro station located less than a block away that will get you anywhere in the city very quickly. Still, Plaça d'Espanya, Montjuic, and the lovely restaurants in El Poble-Sec are all a quick walk away. There are also two cafes for breakfast or afternoon drinks on the same block, as well as a couple of 24-hour supermarkets to stock up on water (or, in my case, late-night double chocolate Magnum bars). The room is huge by European standards. The bed was on the firm side. I like firm beds, so I slept like a baby the entire week we were there. Your experience may differ. Our only complaints are that the toilet and shower are enclosed by frosted glass, but are open to the room. Don’t expect to shower or do any “private business” without your partner noticing. Also, this is an energy-efficient room. You stick your hotel key into a portal by the door to turn the power on in the room. In summer, it takes a bit for the room to cool off as the A/C only kicks on when your key is in that portal. This didn’t bother us, but some people (especially Americans) like to walk into a room that is constantly cooled by air conditioning. Finally, there are recycling bins right outside the hotel. One night, the recycling trucks picked them up at 2:00 AM. Being woken up by the sound of 1,000 glass bottles shattering into the back of a truck was not a pleasant experience. Otherwise, we noticed no noise at night as the hotel sits on a quiet street. Overall, it was a really nice experience – even if you’re heterosexual. I would recommend this to anyone staying in Barcelona as the value is excellent.

There were no Happy Hours no Music, no entertainment at all. It's not worth it to stay there because of the name... beside from above mentioned points Hotel is ok. A big Thank you to the Hote-Staff they are always friendly and saying Hi, there was only one lady which even did't look up or said Hi to guests, all other from keepers to reception to pool bar very friendly guys.",3,"Friendly Staff, Small Rooms",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7806223-r506107113-TWO_Hotel_Barcelona_by_Axel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,269seril

Some great little places to eat and drink around as well as the convenience of Mini Marts. The roof top pool is small and unique and obviously very busy in the sunshine. The room was lovely and clean and the balcony was great to sit out at night after a day sightseeing & dinner. The welcome at the hotel wasn’t the warmest we’ve received and we did eventually get offered a welcome drink. We were lucky the room was ready early, or so we thought, however a request to have a room away from the lifts wasn’t met & out room door was opposite the lifts….not ideal when you are a light sleeper. I appreciate requests can’t always be met but a room directly opposite the lift and next door to a noisy family with a baby wasn’t quite what we wanted and couldn’t have been any further from our request. Clearly no benefit of being an H10 member at the lower levels. The biggest let down for us was the reception staff, housekeeping were great & very friendly but the receptionist seemed as though you were interrupting them if you had a query. We had a note put through our door on the 29th June stating there would be a taxi strike on the 30th June (we weren’t worried as we were checking out & going home on the 29th) foolishly we took that as gospel and enjoy the most of our last day, only to realise the hotel had misinformed us and there were no Taxi’s available on the 29th….not ideal when I was suffering in pain with my foot/ankle. when I question the receptionist on this there was no apology or no attempt to help, just told “take the Metro”…….. Lesson learned the hard way to not trust what we are told in future and to question. Such as shame to be left with a bitter taste in our mouths after what was a wonderful visit to Barcelona. We will be back but not the this hotel.",3,Great Location....lacking customer care,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6510499-r501680963-H10_Art_Gallery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Laura G

At the end of a day of touring, all you want is to escape from the masses (stay away from the old quarter) and enjoy a glass of wine by a pool. Ahh! H10 Art Gallery has both the location and the pool (on its rooftop). If you like art, then you have a bonus as there is a gallery in the basement with exhibition as well as permanent collection throughout the hotel. In fact, each floor is named after an artist. While all of that makes for a huge winner in Barcelona, there are a few areas that could use improvement: the carpets are worn and the rooms (at least ours) had markings on the walls from wear and tear. The pool is a great escape but be forewarned that it is shallow so no diving! Either way, you'll love the view and you can order drinks and food to enjoy your rest. There is a small training room next to the pool but we never used the exercise since we walked all day. Service is fine - not over the top - but you receive a welcome glass of cava (champagne) and cleaning is very good. Breakfast is a nice buffet and most people enjoy that.

The breakfast menu was brought to us for the cooked breakfast , and there were plenty of choices for the fresh additional continental breakfast. Our room was small and kept very clean and tidy by the housekeeping staff. It was a quiet internal room on the fifth floor and had a lovely ensuite. The wifi worked very well in our room. There was a docking station for recharging my daughters phone. The complimentary coffee is quite strong espresso in small cups. I always take a travel kettle and mugs with me however the hotel says it does supply kettles on request. Room service is prompt, and friendly. The decor was delightful and we loved the themed floors and galleries. The staff left us a note in our room to warn us in advance of taxi and airport strikes and offered to help with alternative transport to the airport, we had already booked a transfer bus and the hotel confirmed our times for us. The left luggage ,after check out, is carefully ticketed in a room near reception for security (and we had been able to leave passports and cash in our room safe during our stay to comply with our travel insurance).

The special touches, like the toiletries provided, free bottles of water on the first night, and even a little pack of biscuits on the side when we arrived, all made it even nicer. We had a problem which the staff dealt with immediately and very well - the staff were very attentive and provided us with information for how to get to the airport and let us know when there was an issue with taxis. The rooftop pool was the real highlight of the hotel - wasn't too busy, towels were provided again by attentive staff. The pool isn't very deep but was a nice way to get out of the heat, and can see a view of the mountains through the other roofs.

Our room was on the 8th floor and looked out on to road at the front of the hotel, and although the road was busy, the double glazed windows did an excellent job at blocking out the traffic noise. Bed linen and bathroom towels were changed daily and the air conditioning in the room was probably the best I have ever encountered in a hotel - which was a godsend as the outdoor temperature was well in to the 90s.The rooftop bar is excellent with a good selection of beers, spirits and cocktails. The bar really comes alive at night and offers some great views across the city. The rooftop pool is small but ideal for cooling off in when the daytime heat gets too much.My only criticism, and which others have already mentioned, would be the occasional smell from the drains.

They took over the pool and bar area and had no respect for other guests and some were staying on our floor and very loud. This was the last stop for us after an 11 week trip and we were looking forward to sitting by the pool which we were not comfortable in doing.

I go away on most birthdays and am regularly treated to an upgrade or some kind of special treatment/offer. We booked privilege rooms as that was the best available at the time of booking in May and these were located on the 8th floor, opposite side to the road.First impression of the hotel on arrival was not great as we walked into a very small 'warm' lobby...bearing in mind it was over 30c outside, the check in staff replied and said the AC is set to a reasonable temperature, we checked in sweating. However the staff were friendly, so let's not get that mistaken - I again asked if there is any special treats for birthday's and I was offered a bottle of Cava (which I did not take in the end). Upon getting out of the lift on the 8th floor and heading to our rooms, the corridor had a terrible odour. Someone on here mentions how good the AC was in the rooms, all 3 rooms we had, the AC did not go below 19c and we even had a maintenance guy come up to have a look, so not quite sure what happened there.Rooms were not amazing, we all said that if their privilege rooms are like that, what are the standard ones like? For Barcelona (our first time there), I understand the rooms are not too bad, again down to personal opinion...Corridors can be very noisy, soundproofing would go very far....did not get a good nights sleep as some kind of construction seemed to be taking place outside.Also be very careful with the wifi, which can be temperamental and seems to log you out automatically, we were using Youtube to stream music not realising that half the time our phones switched back to 4G, which after a week is a lot, so we are expecting heavy bills over our usual UK monthly allowed data usage. Let's not be totally negative and move to the roof top bar & pool....Looks great on pictures but in reality the pool is tiny and I only went in it once and that was 8.30am. Daytime you can forget about it unless you enjoy being in a small crowded/tight space, with a group of drunk English lads (yes I am English myself)....The corridor by the bar had a terrible smell of sewage that never seemed to disappear. The Gym is a bit of a joke 7 small and the roof top terrace very bland....again in pictures it all looks good.The biggest positive I will take with me upon leaving the hotel is a couple of the staff there, Augustine at the rooftop bar but the one who stood out a million miles was a barman called Nico....'He is the man!!'...once we got chatting to him, he made us so welcome and advised on great places to visit for food/drink etc and believe me he knows his stuff! His service is second to none too and always with a smile!Hotel food is above average and if you get the corner sofa's on the roof top terrace with a group of friends, you will definitely make the most playing music, chatting and drinking away...albeit the roof top is small overall.Intriguing hotel but truth be known, I don't see myself coming back there again for a long time if ever.",3,Did not live up to the expectation!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d230643-r503857602-Barcelona_Universal_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,TravelReviewKing1

I'll start this review by saying we have traveled all over North America and this is our 3rd trip to Europe. We always travel to 4 to 5 countries for as many weeks. So depending on location, season and certainly our budget we have stayed in large, small 3, 4 and 5 star properties, even in a hostel( which was more superior to this hotel)! So in fairness, we have experienced many levels of quality and service with each property. In my view, THIS IS a 3 star hotel at best!! The booking site AGODA had completely dropped the ball by not communicating our special request that ""it was our 30th anniversary and we would appreciate any special consideration "". Upon checking in, they had no record of it!! When we mentioned it, no one even acknowledged or said congratulations. I do recognize that we booked a ""standard"" room but what we got (#201) was the absolute worse room a hotel can offer. This hotel and its parent company NN Group should be ashamed to market a room like this to its guests. The room had a small ""frosted"" window which you can't see through (never seen that before!!) It opened to a courtyard with full of construction junk and noise. The room is small and dilapidated(see pics). After complaining, the front desk person, said "" Oh, I know 201. I'll move you"". Apparently it was a room with some history! Then they moved us ""one floor up"" to a room that had a normal window at least! It opened however to the balconies of a run down residential neighborhood that looked liked it was in a war zone (see pics)!! The noise insulation is nonexistent. You can hear every shower, flush and step of any adjoining room. The A/C has no thermostat function so you either freeze or have to turn it off manually to moderate the room temperature. The bathroom had mold and mildew all around the tub. At our checkout, I asked a manager to look at the bathroom so at least he can do something about it!! I WILL certainly share my observations with their corporate offices. The hotel certainly tainted our impression of Barcelona and was not the stay we had envisioned by a long shot!",1,3 star hotel at best!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d230643-r502151460-Barcelona_Universal_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,mehmin

Lovely, clean, quiet and comfortable room. Spacious bathroom with nice amenities. Quick elevators. Excellent free WiFi. Wonderful breakfast buffet (optional at additional cost - we included breakfast in our booking). Over-the-top service, especially the concierge and the hotel manager. Excellent restaurant for dinner, too (Don Giovanni).The highlight of outstanding concierge service was solving a complicated baggage problem, when on short notice, we needed to send two 50 lb. suitcases to our next hotel in Madrid. The concierge found a suitable courier service at a reasonable cost, arranged for pick-up, and took our suitcases under the hotel's care until the courier accepted them for shipment. The next time we saw the suitcases was in our hotel room in Madrid. The concierge also helped us with directions, gave us good restaurant recommendations, and provided a decent map to guide us while we toured the city on foot.The hotel manager inquired several times about how we were enjoying our stay, and even wrote a personal note thanking us for our patronage. Service from his staff was totally professional.The breakfast buffet was a joy! Extensive offerings of all sorts of meats, cheeses, breads and pastries, jams and jellies, sushi, eggs cooked to order, sandwiches, fruits, coffees, loose-leaf teas, cold beverages including juices, and even a smoothie bar. Great service, too, as you sit with the plates you filled from the buffet, then servers bring your drinks and any hot foods you ordered (like the freshly cooked omelets we enjoyed). Bring your appetite to breakfast, eat heartily, and you may not need to eat again until dinner!This hotel is very conveniently located very near Catalunya Plaza and thereby the northern end of La Rambla. It's about a 20 minute walk from the hotel via La Rambla to the waterfront where Columbus Monument is situated. If you fancy great tapas, the hotel is only a minute's walk to Ciudad Condal, (reviewed separately as well).If you are looking for top quality accommodations, great service, and convenient location, you definitely should consider NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calderón as one of Barcelona's best.",5,Fabulous Stay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d206921-r504940494-NH_Collection_Barcelona_Gran_Hotel_Calderon-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,DeniseInAz

As my wife, our two adult daughters and I were going to be in Barcelona for only one night, I wanted a convenient location in the heart of Barcelona. I was already familiar with the area, having previously stayed multiple times in a nearby hotel. This time I wanted a somewhat more elegant place and the Roger De Lluria seemed to fit the bill. I booked two double rooms for a Sunday night and requested twin beds, high floor and facing the street. On the Friday before our scheduled arrival, we decided to arrive a day early. My daughter called the hotel and asked if there was availability the next day. The answer was no, but a few minutes later the desk clerk (Hakim) called back to say they could provide two rooms for the first night, although he warned they would be smaller and not as well located as the rooms we would have the second night. Unfortunately, the price would be the same as for the better and bigger rooms (200 Euros per room per night), but Hakim said he would include breakfast for the first morning. Therefore, even before our arrival, we had a sample of the friendly and helpful service provided by the hotel's staff. And after our arrival, there were other examples. I had parked my car a couple of streets away (see why below) and asked if it was ok to leave it there until our departure early Monday morning. The bellman said it should be, but went on to tell me I could park from 10 pm that night until Monday morning on Roger De Lluria. He recommended that I move my car at 10 so it would be right in front of the hotel from Saturday night until our departure. Great advice!The rooms we had were nicely furnished and the second night they were quite spacious and had balconies. The rooms we had the first night (103 and 403) had very spacious bathrooms, but the rooms were really single rooms in a corner of the hotel (i.e., with no view) with a double bed pushed into a corner (with one side against a wall). As they were provided in response to our last minute change of plans, we could not complain. There was no obvious place to temporarily park my car in front of the hotel to unload our luggage or even to stop it long enough to run into the hotel to ask about that. So, anyone driving to the hotel should ask in advance what to do with their car when checking in.",4,Pleasant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d232774-r501126567-Hotel_Roger_De_Lluria_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,sturutoo

POSITIVES: Location is really good. We booked a room ($1,000 for 3 nights) with a private terrace that was nice, the terrace was large and you could easily have a small party there if you wanted to invite over some friends. I liked the tiled floors in our room and that it also had a little living room, so the space felt like a junior suite. Room had a safe and a nice mini bar, and good space for hanging clothes and shelves for laying out your stuff. That was good. There was a shower on the terrace (not private but still nice). The bed was soft and very comfortable. Loved the pillows. Super hair dryer so leave yours at home. I liked the reception staff so much and the large lounge space downstairs (green room) was super for chilling out and hopping on wifi. The coffee shop downstairs (Satan's) had excellent coffee and donuts. The roof was my favorite spot; I loved it up there lounging on the sofas looking out over the city…NEGATIVES: Hotel is very loud on the weekends (Friday and Saturday night) and turns into a party space since they have a DJ downstairs - loud music until 3 or 4am. Had multiple occasions when drunk guests tried to get into our room between 2-4am, maybe I would have felt safer with my husband but I was with another girl and I didn’t feel safe. I went to bed around 12:30 each night but couldn't sleep until 3 or 4 because of all of the doors slamming, screaming, party noise and our doorknob being rattled a lot. I wasn't in the city to party so I think I stayed at the wrong hotel, maybe if you come to party this place would be perfect. Bathroom was tiny, shower and toilet in a small closet and the sink out in the hallway. If you like more space and privacy in a bathroom, this isn't your place. The service was terrible in the green lounge room downstairs (but to be fair, great on the roof). Cleaning staff was good, but they left our terrace door open after cleaning once and with a lot of expensive things in our room, we didn't appreciate coming back to the room with our terrace door open (we always locked the terrace intentionally before leaving each day). No A/C in the rooms and no windows, so it gets very hot in the room because opening the terrace doors would not have felt safe with all of the rowdy guests around us. I’m not sure who was in the room next to us, but they kept screaming and hitting the walls and singing loudly, it was ridiculous, I tried to call reception but no one answered. The walls are paper-thin so you'll need earplugs if you are a light sleeper.OVERALL: To be fair, it’s a nice property with many good points but I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, because for the price, you can definitely get a much better, safer, and more luxurious hotel in the city. For a first time stay for an extended weekend, it was okay. I've stayed at hotels all over the world, so maybe I'm also just more particular than the average traveler who isn't on the road each month... Overall, it was fine but sort of hyped up according to the reviews I’ve read.",3,Mixed Feelings...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8780848-r501634102-Casa_Bonay-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Holly B

Be aware that the A/C in our street view room couldn't keep up and/or possibly because it is controlled from the hotel, they wouldn't bump it up. But they brought us a very quiet portable room A/C which worked great throughout our stay. The hotel photos on this site show the top floor (there aren't other balcony rooms and some have no windows at all) so know what you're booking. Location is AMAZING. It's like Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Read the fine print about booking with breakfast included. It is good but you don't want to be locked into a $30 euro breakfast every day as the selections would get stale after 1 meal there and you must eat before 10am. Also you can always eat there for $10 euros daily and I understand you could order omelettes specially made for you. The only complaint is the room was so modern and minimalistic that they didn't have major conveniences like drawers, towel bars or counter space!? The nightstand has a large lamp so you can barely use the surface. We had a street facing room and blackout shade was 100% and windows blocked ALL noise. Two of Gaudi's works are within 3 blocks of the hotel. One is next door. Safe area. Taxis everywhere. Stupid humid all day in the summer mid-80's. Terrace bar had 360 views and great drink but food is sub par for the cost so eat somewhere else. Bottom line, this hotel and everyone who worked there gave impeccable service, despite the language barrier. They were very patient and genuinely wanted to help me with my bad Spanish.",5,Great Location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4463171-r505504754-Hotel_Royal_Passeig_de_Gracia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,pdoqui

The trip was for my fiance's birthday and we wanted to end the trip with a short city stay in Barcelona. We booked one night at this hotel on the last night of our trip, our flight was at 10pm the next evening and we were drawn by the good reviews and complimentary late check out giving us the opportunity to have a late night out enjoying the nightlife while still being able to rest until 2pm before check out. We arrived at 5pm via taxi after dropping our rental car at the airport. We were greeted by the worst arrival I have ever experienced at a supposedly 4* hotel. Our greeting by Mr Feran [--] consisted of a very cold reception, charging our card on arrival leaving €2 to pay on departure which was the city tax (very strange), on asking why we were told ""maybe you are not used to this class of hotel"" (at €180 per night I have stayed in many hotels which demand double or triple this price and we have also stayed in many hotels which were less expensive but much nicer service/standards), he then proceeded to try to joke around with us that the payment was being made off my fiances card insinuating I was being cheap or needed her to pay for it (its a joint American Express account which we have separate cards for in both our names respectively), he also tried to joke with us that we had gone for the cheaper option with no breakfast included (we arranged to meet another couple we know who live in Barcelona for lunch and planned to have a late night out enjoying the night life so didn't see the need to include a breakfast which we would not be eating). All in all it was the worst check in experience we have ever experienced. Mainly down to one staff member Feran [--] who tried to humiliate us personally and our stay at this decidedly average hotel. We may dress casually but, I run a web design company and employ 8 people and my fiance works as a junior financial advisor so we both earn very good money. Never judge a book by its cover. We had planned to get tapas and a bottle of champagne on the amazing looking roof terrace but after this welcome we couldn't wait to leave. We found THE MOST AMAZING Tapas restaurant/bar called Vivo which was a 5 minute walk from the hotel and after reading the reviews of the tapas at the hotel I'm glad in a way that Feran was such a terrible host and put us off eating at the hotel. Wow what a meal at Vivo, and the champagne service was amazing very highly recommended. Anyway, back to the hotel. The room was average. It had been nicely done but had a sterile chain hotel feel. The room we stayed in was the Superior Room which had no fresh air because it was a glass wall with no open-able window which was a little strange and made the room very stuffy even with air con at the lowest setting of 19 degrees. As we left to go out for the evening I requested Feran to write his full name on a piece of paper for the purpose of this review to which he first refused, I then requested his manager to which he wrote the name (at no point did he ask if there was a problem he could help with or if we were comfortable in our stay, which is what I expected him to do and maybe rectify the problem and apologize for his behavior) instead he aggressively wrote the name and passed it to me then stared at us as we left the hotel through the front doors and carried on staring us down as we walked off down the road (very strange). We stayed out partying till 4am and arrived back to the room to neither of our cards working in our room doors so had to go back to reception and get them to re-do our room cards.We set an alarm for 8am to call reception and request our late check out as we had been advised. When we called we were told this was not available as the hotel was ""fully booked"" (bearing in mind it was a Monday night out of tourist season so I wonder when the heavily advertised late check out would be available if not then). We decided to stay in bed till midday as we planned to and to check out at 1pm anyway instead of 2pm as we had planned originally according to their heavily advertised complimentary late check out. It was one of the main reasons we had booked the hotel so we could make the most of the short stay and famous nightlife. We were harassed from 12:05pm with phone call after phone call from reception threatening us with extra charges and to come to the room and take our bags out. We checked out at 1pm an hour before we originally planned. What a stay. And what a strange, terrible and dishonest hotel.Thanks,Christopher Ribeiro-Barwick.",1,"Worst welcome, misleading late check-out, no window, pre charge on card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4463171-r501531925-Hotel_Royal_Passeig_de_Gracia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Bazman b

The bed is incredibly comfortable and they add a special touch by bringing you the number of bottles of water that you need, which is always appreciated with a 30+ degree temperature. The spa and the pool are great, while the gym, albeit small, is well equipped. The only minor dislike I had was with the pool/rooftop restaurant staff as I felt they were not at par with the rest of the hotel. The hotel is walking distance to La Pedrera and Casa Batlò. My friend and I like to walk and we had no problem walking from the hotel to the port or La Sagrada Familia. There are plenty of restaurants around and it's a very safe neighborhood.

Reported to reception but not fixed during our stay. The second room was on the 7th floor and was a double but was noticeably smaller. There was a very strong smell of drains or something similar in the room which was made worse when the air conditioning was on?

The shower was over the bath which was very slow to drain away and the cleaner started leaving the plug out of the bath.

Firstly, to us and for our plans it was perfectly situated. L'Eixample is a underrated part of the city and you can cover a lot of the city simply by walking from the hotel. We had a standard double room which is very small, but that is noted on the web page. No problem. The building itself is awesome and would probably be an attraction itself if it wasn't a hotel. However, we did feel it wasn't very well cleaned. I dropped something underneath the bathroom sink and it was unpleasant, to say the least, to pick it up. I didn't check underneath the bed but since the rooms are so small, I imagine it's difficult to clean properly without breaking your back. The staff didn't come across as perfectly neutral. Nothing to really mention. The air condition unit in the room was a little bit of a problem. I can't really sleep without it, but it was so old and noisy it also became a problem to sleep when it was running. There was no way to adjust the fan speed, and it didn't seem to have any other function than on and off. And ""on"" was pretty cold. I understand it is because it's an old building, but things never seemed to dry off properly which in turn led it to constantly feeling quite humid in the rooms. It would've helped if we could open up the window in the bathroom. We had no problems with the wifi, as others have commented on. The style, colors and bathrooms in particular are really well thought through and executed. Would I stay again? Yes, but would probably go for a larger room with an exterior view.",3,"Great location, but...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1482943-r503177824-Hotel_Praktik_Rambla-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Mikael B

The selection at breakfast was fantastic with an incredible choice of top quality food. I didn't eat in the restaurant as it was closed for refurbishment but if the food is as good as the breakfast would certainly try.

Reception staff accused me of trying to leave without paying at check-out, despite us having paid them the full fare at check-in. I stayed here 15-17 July, checked-in with my boyfriend but checked-out by myself.I thought it was a bit strange that they charged us at check-in, also charged us a different price then quoted on Booking.com when I booked - about 15% more - and I pointed that out and they said it was due to taxes. They also scanned both our passports and had us fill some forms with our home address and contact details. They issued us a receipt which I showed to the check-out staff as proof of payment, but the check-out staff wouldn't accept it, claiming it was for another room and that my name didn't appear on the receipt. They also refused to return the receipt I handed them and kept it. Despite the lengthy check-in process with the passport scans, reception staff at check-out 2 days later claimed they had no records of our check-in or payment. I asked them to check records of payments that day, in both their booking system and their accounting but they did not want to help, instead acting suspicious towards me and asking me questions indicating they didn't believe me. Eventually I had to pay again to end the scene and leave. This time the fee I was charged was exactly the price we were quoted on Booking.com and different from what we paid at check-in. Again, strange. There was probably a mistake somewhere and I asked the reception staff to consider this but they did not want to co-operate, had probably decided by that point that I'm attempting a fraud instead of trying to help me. My boyfriend and I came back to the hotel together later that week, when the first payment appeared in our online bank statement to try to get a refund for it (it was lucky that we were still in Barcelona). This time around there was an extra desk in the lobby where a customer relation staff person. She was polite and willing to help and agreed to look into it and they eventually refunded us one of the payments.That still doesn't make up for the horrible check-out when I was by myself, being accused of trying to leave without paying in a lobby full of people and having to defend my claim after they rejected and took away my receipt. It's the worst experience I've had in a hotel.Not that any other feature of the hotel matters much after this experience, but I thought the rooms were not that great.There was dust in the room and in the bathroom, the bathroom sink was blocked and the room looked very uninviting, like a metal cube. We asked for a double bed when we booked but we were given two single beds.The most annoying thing was that bed linen did not have a proper duvet cover, it was just two sheets with the duvet in the middle so during the night when you moved you would touch the duvet (which presumably doesn't get washed after every guest like the bed sheets are). Very unhygienic. This is marketed as a 3 star hotel, but the rooms definitely don't live up to that expectation and the reception staff attitude is not acceptable to treat a guest and a paying customer.",1,Rude and unprofessional reception staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d651381-r506708789-NH_Collection_Constanza-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,irinanastasel

It's far enough out that you don't get traffic of transport or people, but it has plenty of great bars surrounding it.There is a lovely restaurant attached to the hotel (Bruc33). It's a tapas restaurant which is fairly priced, but great if you're in a rush or having a late dinner.The staff were lovely and friendly and swiftly checked us in when we arrived. We were provided with a map and the member of staff highlighted key places of interest and explained how far away they were.The room itself was great, we were on the second floor and even had a small balcony. There was a safe provided, hangers, a hairdryer and a mini bar. The shower was great and the room was very clean. The only fault I could find with the room was that the walls were a little thin. Luckily, we didn't hear conversations but we could hear people in the corridor and in the rooms next to us slamming their doors. The room was cleaned every day which was great and we were provided with new towels when we needed them. There is also a fantastic rooftop bar. The first night we had two drinks which cost €7.

It is also only a 5-10 minute walk from Placa de Catalunya, and the top of La Rambla, and a short walk from the Barri Gotic and El Born areas. Being located a short walk from all these areas also means that it is in a quieter area than some hotels in Barcelona, and we found it very peaceful each night and easy to get a good nights sleep.The room itself was spacious enough for 2 people, and had a comfortable bed, a nice bathroom with a very large shower, shower gel and shampoo and a hairdryer, a safe, and a lovely little balcony/terrace area, which had a couple of seats and was a lovely place to sit and have a snack, and overlooked a quiet courtyard type area. The room also had a minibar, which was just a small fridge which we used to put our own drinks/snacks in and was incredibly useful. The air conditioning in the room worked perfectly, making the room a lovely cool temperature to retreat in to when it was nearly 40 degrees outside!The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful, and were quick to respond to emails that I had sent them before booking the hotel.There is a restaurant next door if you would like to buy breakfast or dinner. We didn't visit the restaurant though so can't say if the food was good. The hotel has a rooftop bar, which we visited on one evening and wish we had managed to visit more often. The man serving was very friendly and had a bit of a joke with us, the drinks were good and a reasonable price and the atmosphere was great. It wasn't a huge area but it was nicely done and we would recommend having at least one drink up there.As said in the title, the hotel definitely deserves more than 2 stars and we would 100% stay here again, as we could not find another hotel with a private balcony, rooftop bar, private bathrooms and minibar for the same price.

This room has no view because it looks out onto a brick wall just a few feet away from the window. We could not even see any sky. We were also disappointed to discover it was just a very large room with a bed, sofa and a small table with 2 chairs. We have stayed in similar sized/equipped rooms in other hotels and this room would have been sold as an ‘executive’ room. The hotel description lists ‘Two flat screen LCD TV’s’ which implies you would have two separate rooms. In fact the room has just one TV, because it is just one room. The room is supplied with a Nespresso coffee machine, but because of the positioning of the few electric points in the room, we had to balance it beside the basin in the bathroom (the alternative would be to place it on the very small designer lump of wood that served as a bedside table or place the machine on the floor). The coffee machine comes with just 4 complimentary pods and after that you are expected to pay 3 Euro’s for any additional coffee pods.The bed was comfortable, but a good night’s sleep was not achievable because the walls were very thin and noise/conversations from the neighbouring rooms and corridor were clearly audible. On Monday our neighbours had an early morning wakeup call at 6am – we really appreciated that! We also appreciated the children of another family ringing the doorbell to our room and running away!The shower got top marks but then lost a few because the hidden pipe work became noisy during peak periods. The hotel were not able to resolve this issue during our stay.The most amusing part of our stay, was a call from the customer relations the day before check out to ask if we appreciated the hotel/room. Of course, we expressed our disappointments and was then asked,‘Would you like a wakeup call tomorrow morning, to make your experience with us even better?’, ‘No, we don’t want a wakeup call, and that would not make our experience with you even better. We are disappointed with the room’Customer relations response was ‘OK. Goodbye’.We won’t be staying at Hotel Claris again.",3,Disappointed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d190615-r505500464-Hotel_Claris-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Alison A

Although our room was situated on the first floor facing the busy street of Via Lietana, there was no problem at all with noise from the street on an evening.

The hot food is cooked to order, but to be honest wasn't that nice. The bacon was really fatty and greasy, the eggs also greasier than fried eggs elsewhere. On our first day, the order was delivered wrong. Also, I'm pretty sure the hot mushrooms were from a can. Fresh fruit was rarely topped up while we were there, so we missed out on some.

Most important to us is service and the staff here is exceptional. Though small, they really look after every detail and make sure you are comfortable and secure. The staff is very helpful from helping book excursions to tips on the best places to eat, shop and when to do what. I believe there are only 30 rooms at this hotel. We had a 3rd floor room with a small balcony overlooking La Ramblas. The room was probably entry level, thus very small, but we have been in smaller. You can hear the Metro below the hotel for the lower floor rooms. We heard it on the 3rd floor, but it was honestly not a bother and never disturbed our sleep - maybe because we were so exhausted every evening. The 6th floor rooms are the jacuzzi suites. The roof top bar is very quiet, as it is primarily hotel guest. The pool is really just to sit around and soak your feet while having cocktails. Nice place for a drink before you head out for the evening.The hotel location is very secure with many police patrolling the area. You are in the center of La Ramblas and in the heart of the Gothic quarter, so everything is at your finger tips from shops to restaurants to the La Boqueria market, which is almost next door. You are also a very short walk from the Metro, which proves invaluable for visits to Sagrada Família and Park Güell.Our recommendation for your visit would be to dig deep into the Gothic quarter for restaurants and shops, not the ones right on La Ramblas. They are so much more intimate and really help you enjoy the culture. Also, if you want to eat close to the hotel, go behind the catholic church just next door and there is a square there with great restaurants and really nice atmosphere. So close and mostly locals. We had dinner and drinks at Bar Lobo. We also really enjoyed the tranquility of Gats after a crazy long walking day. It was nice to find peace and great eats so close to our hotel. Both of these places are in this square.Important tips:If you have Verizon - the $10/day travel plan is awesome - no data/call/text limitsCall your credit and debit card companies before travelling to avoid purchase stops.Don't get euros in US - simply use ATM machine at airport in Spain & avoid ALL fees.Don't forget your electrical converters - bring extras for charging multiple devices.Barcelona has pickpockets.

Having never been to Barcelona we were not sure where we wanted to stay. We knew we wanted to be close to the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla but not in the heart of it, H10 accomplished that. We arrived very early after disembarking a cruise ship. While our room was not ready at 8:30am, the front desk staff where very welcoming with water and champagne. They took our bags and put them in a secure area so we could explore the city without worry. The front desk also helped us book tour bus passes, schedule a visit to La Sagrada Familia and book tickets to Museu de Design de Barcelona to see the exhibit “Dave Bowe is”. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. After spending most of the day exploring the city we came back to get our room. We checked in a very spacious Superior Barcelona room on the 6th floor. It was a corner unit that faced the street (Via Laietana). At first I was concerned there would be a lot of street noise at night, but the windows are so thick we could not hear anything. From there we checked out the wonderful roof top bar and pool. It was a nice little oasis on a hot day which gave us some time to relax after a day of walking in the hot sun. What we really liked about this hotel was how modern and well appointed it is. We also really like its location. It was about a 5 minute walk to La Rambla, Placa de Catalunya, Catedral de Barcelona and Passeig de Gracia (where all the high end shops are). I also felt very safe as we walked back from dinner in the Gothic Quarter. The morning we left it was a little difficult to get a taxi, but the staff at the front desk went out of their way to get us one to the airport. It was a really great stay and I will return here when I am back in Barcelona.",5,Perfect Barcelona Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8778628-r510142747-H10_Cubik-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,tolopez

Modern design in the heart of the district. The location is excellent - lots to see in the area. Felt very safe walking around. Service was superb. Our room was not ready when we arrived as we came right after our ship returned to port; however, they kept our luggage safe and we enjoyed the rooftop pool as we waited (gave us welcome drink vouchers as well). Lovely surroundings, fresh towels, ordered tomato & mozzarella flatbread sandwiches (excellent) and drinks. Plenty of seating, even covered areas to keep shade from the sun. All staff was very friendly and polite. My husband overheard another guest talking about a futbol match that evening, so the front desk staff arranged to have tickets for us at the last minute - complete with balcony seats & 2 jerseys for our children (note: this was not inexpensive, but we thought it would be an unforgettable experience for our family so we went with it.) My husband had wifi so he could get some work done in the nicely furnished lobby. We had a suite (well worth the price) which had plenty of room for our family of 4 (1 large shower and another tub/shower combination, 1 large bed for my husband & I and 2 other twin beds made up for the kids, large desk area, 2 TV's). Even had room darkening shades. We ordered room service late at night and it was delivered quickly. (Note: there is no space for a tip on checks for food/drinks, so it is best to keep some cash on hand to tip if you'd like).Breakfast buffet was included in our rate, but we had to leave early for our flight; they were happy to pack up some food to take away for us - so accommodating. They even arranged to have a taxi ready to go when we needed it.I couldn't have been happier with our choice. Highly recommend!",5,Wish we could have stayed longer!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d583963-r510484374-Grand_Hotel_Central-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Dorismini

It did not disappoint.Upon arrival we received a warm welcome from Elena on reception. Elena informed me that we had been upgraded to an Executive room which was a nice gesture and very much appreciated. She also changed our reservation at city restaurant as our flight had been delayed (reviewed separately). There are two elevators, one solely for guest use opposite reception and one for guest and visitor use to the sky bar which is just right of the reception. The other staff in reception seemed to leave us alone :)The executive room was very spacious with an enormous bed and a beautifully designed walk in shower and separate hand wash area (sadly no bath). A friendly welcome message regarding our anniversary was accompanied by a bottle of Cava, again a very welcome gesture. The room was designed to a very high specification with black slate in the wash area and wood effect flooring in the sleeping area, with lighting to give a relaxing ambience. Gilchrist & Soames shower products were also a nice addition. Having read reviews regarding noise, I can say that we slept very well throughout our stay in room 220 and was undisturbed through the night, especially with the excellent air conditioning system. Complimentary refreshments (water, cola, orange juice, beer and crisps) are provided daily from the in room fridge. The cleaning team are the unsung heroes of this hotel, they do a fantastic job day and night and deserve a lot of credit for keeping the rooms perfectly clean and an exceptional turndown service.Breakfast was great with a fantastic selection of hot and cold foods, with nespresso coffee upon request. The scrambled eggs are excellent and will be greatly missed. The staff are attentive upon greeting, my only observation being that the waiting staff do not always ask if you would like an additional hot drink, a very minor criticism.We spent most of the day sunbathing on the rooftop terrace. The day staff are efficient, especially the young lady who called me 'sweetie', made our days very comfortable and memorable. The music is relaxing and for our stay there were plenty of sun loungers to choose from. I enjoyed the pool and it's stunning views of the university district, overlooking the houses and churches to the rear of the hotel, sadly no view of sagrada la familia, but a hotel cannot have it all :)....there is a nice selection of hot sandwiches for around €10 each and coffee for €4 and cold drinks, as well as small meals from €10+ along with delicious cocktails for around €14....I could have stayed there all day and did in fact miss some of our excursions due to not wanting to leave the comfortable terrace. After a long day sightseeing and shopping we came back to the hotel and visited the rooftop bar for drinks on the evening...this time of day the bar is open to the public, it is here I feel the service suffers slightly as it is VERY popular and busy, with the manager doing his best to make everyone happy, one or two of the waiting staff seemed to display signs of fatigue affecting their normally welcoming manner, but I understand the hotel is a business and must be opened to the public to make it profitable.Thank you all for making our anniversary very special. I think I met Jaime, guest relations manager whom I had been conversing with prior to our stay via email, on our departure. Jaime ensured everything was taken care of regarding our bill and public transport options due to a taxi strike.If you are looking for a trendy, luxurious hotel with a boutique feel in the heart of the gothic district, this is the hotel for you, I guarantee you will enjoy every moment.

Our friends minded our kids for 24 hours so we could go on a chill-out/romantic getaway to Barcelona. We booked at this hotel which is the most fancy place we have ever been to. The experience was in one word: amazing.Not only because this place is ridiculously tasteful, chilled-out and cool, but because of the people who work there.There is a roof top bar I must talk about before going further, it is insane with a small pool overlooking the whole city and during the day time it is only open for customers of the hotel which makes it super quiet and nice for a lazy read in the sun.Now, back to the real deal. There is a guy who fronts the reception of the hotel who is called Saúl Canal. This man is some sort of a super god to us now cause we have seriously never, ever been treated so wonderfully as he did when he found out our get-away situation.He made our trip in one word: amazing!He gave us some sort of superstar treatment the whole time (a little due to his love of Iceland where we come from but also just out of his kind heart I think).

There seemed to be even more closet space (due to some rearrangement of the closets’ interiors) and we much appreciated the addition of the spacious in-room safe. As always, the room was quiet and comfortably cool (Barcelona was quite summery while we were there). And, as before, the housekeeping staff was cheerful and did a good job, and (even when we needed to use the room after breakfast until fairly late in the morning) was very considerate. In fact, the staff as a whole was quite pleasant and welcoming. The buffet breakfast was tasty with good ingredients, including eggs and meats and cold alternatives, and everything was refilled promptly; the new coffee brewer (now with café americano) worked fast and another nice improvement. As always, the location is unexcelled, perfectly situated where the Gothic quarter meets Eixample and Raval—the three areas of Barcelona that have (along with great restaurants and shopping) the attractions of greatest interest to visitors.

He'd researched several hotels and areas before choosing the H10 Metropolitan which is literally at the top of Las Rambla. Perfect location, friendly staff and our upgraded premium room on the 6th floor, with a balcony overlooking the outdoor terrace and pool, was great. The hotel has 2 pools - a plunge pool on 6th floor with small area for sunbathing and a larger one on the ground floor with a large sun terrace just above. You can order drinks at the bar there and they will bring over bring to you on the terrace. Bar prices were surprisingly reasonable for beer and wine (around 4 euros for a glass). The Albariño is delicious!! A bottle of cava is around 23 euros and is of very good quality. It's a small hotel so one tip is to go down to the bar to order drinks and take back to room yourself instead of paying the extra 5 euros for it to be delivered. Our room (608) had a huge walk in shower, super comfortable queen size bed, a docking station and a Nespresso machine, which we made much use of each morning. The hotel had organised a bottle of cava and some chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room to celebrate our anniversary - what a lovely touch! We only had breakfast at their Kitchen restaurant once and on the last morning of our stay. Although it was pricey at 23 euros each I'd recommend you try it at least once during your stay as the scale and quality of the buffet was fantastic. As well as a menu of hot food to choose from (we had perfectly cooked poached egg, crispy bacon and waffle with maple syrup.. yum), the buffet had endless volumes of small cakes, hams, cheeses, breads, small sandwiches, biscuits, salads .. phew. The list goes on! The service was prompt and friendly with regular coffee top ups offered throughout. Everything in the hotel was meticulously clean and the quality shines through. It's not the cheapest nor the most expensive place to stay in Barcelona but I'd definitely stay here again. Would highly recommend.",5,Fantastic hotel!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6973853-r506055503-H10_Metropolitan-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,LD1000

Our second visit to Barcelona as it was her choice for an 18th birthday gift from family. Before we arrived, the email responses answering my questions from Bianca were so thoughtful and positive, that we knew we would receive friendly and good service and we were not wrong.......The hotel is very central and just off the main Placa Catalunya. Easily reachable from the airport by the Aerobus which stops nearby and is a 5 minute walk away. The receptionist checking us in was so accommodating and friendly and this continued throughout our time here. The glass of cava on arrival was a nice way to start our stay. Staff were knowledgeable and informative on transport, sightseeing and booking trips and activities etc. The doorman was always happy and polite and greeted us every time we entered or left the hotel. The sweet jars dotted around the hotel lobby and bar were a nice little treat, as was the coffee available anytime and free of charge. We also had complimentary bottles of water each day as H10 members and a free cocktail voucher. The hotel itself is beautifully clean and modern.The surprise in the room for my daughter's birthday was lovely. Chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of cava and little chocolates in boxes.We had a superior twin room on the 6th floor with a terrace facing the courtyard and pool. This was really quiet and relaxing. The beds were fabulous with a choice of pillows. Each person has their own slippers and robes.The room was spotless and cleaned each day. The shower was large and amazing. Lighting in the bathroom was excellent, especially for make up.The breakfast was amazing (so much of it) and the waiting staff were very attentive and professional. Our waitress most days was the lovely Kenneth who always had a smile and was very polite. The shallow plunge pool on the 6th floor was quiet and had fabulous views of the city and Placa Catalunya. The main pool on the ground floor was a bit deeper and very lovely after a hot day sightseeing. The pool bar and service was also excellent.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and family and would certainly love to stay here again one day soon.",5,The fabulous staff make this great hotel even greater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6973853-r504891455-H10_Metropolitan-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Deb F

There is so much to say about this hotel right in the heart of Barcelona at Placa de Catalunya. It could not be more central for many metro and bus links to other parts of the city. The hotel is so tastefully furnished and decorated. Very unusual and unique. The double rooms are small but fantastically equipped with an espresso machine and a kettle in the cupboard for tea drinkers like me. Safe, iron and board. Made use of the fridge in the room but like many people bought our own wine etc to enjoy in the evening on the balcony. Our room was to the front with a small balcony that had a great view over Placa de Catalunya. Not noisy at all when doors closed. Welcoming complimentary bottle of red wine delivered on our 1st night was greatly appreciated along with chocs. Then truffles each night for the rest of our stay were delivered to our room. Such a lovely treat. Spacious shower with an additional hand held one which was a fantastically useful. Gorgeous complimentary toiletries with everything you could possibly need in the event you forget anything. Hairdryer, Robes and slippers too. Towels and beds changed daily. Room was immaculate. Didn't watch much tv but radio had an iPod docking station that was handy to listen to our own playlists. Now to the breakfasts. Wow! What a choice! And so beautifully presented too. Eggs cooked to your choice with plenty of hot sides to accompany, although the continental choice would be adequit. Served by friendly and helpful staff who were always eager to please. All staff in general were so helpful, knowledgeable and wonderful. Right from the start at check-in (which despite arriving early, and due to our room being available we were able to get into it and freshen up after our flight). Reception staff offered us a drink and a seat immediately which to me was a lovely touch. They were all of course efficient and friendly during that process. Bar staff so attentive any time we used it, especially serving drinks to our loungers by the pool. Fantastic service always with a smile. I cannot fault anything about the Metropolitan Hotel and it's staff. I'll definately be returning without hesitation. Note that the T10 card I've always used for Barcelona's fantastic transport system can no longer be used for the Airport Shuttle direct to Placa de Catalunya. You can use the No46 bus from El Prat to Placa Espanya and change to another bus or metro to Placa de Catalunya. However with luggage it's easier and cheaper than a taxi to pay €5.90 for the Airport Shuttle bus. This year I was disappointed to find both Sagrida Familia and Parc Grüel had to be booked online only (which I knew nothing of) prior to visiting only and not at the entrance as I'd hoped to explore more inside both places. Hope the tourist dept sort this for future visitors.",5,Amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6973853-r502923827-H10_Metropolitan-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Magpie620

The location was excellent, very close to plaza catalunya and the gothic quarter, and to the metro. Overall it was a great experience.The only comment I have is that the extra bed (for which the hotel charged 50 euros per night) was very squeaky and did not have the appropriate beddings/sheets. The frame was way too small for the mattress, which can be a fall hazard specially for smaller children. I called twice for the replacement of the sheets to something more comfortable, and they were pretty responsive- however, they do not have beddings for a single /roller bed so they just provided a smaller blanket. It helped a little bit, but I was expecting a proper single bed, for the extra 50 euros a night I paid for, which is quite steep. I hope this can be improved in the future.",3,Overall good but extra bed needs proper beddings,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6973853-r507215049-H10_Metropolitan-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Slgilmo

Unfortunately, he made the reservation so my platinum lifetime status was not honored. He is a gold member and we did get a room upgrade so everybody was very accommodating in that respect. Why we loved this hotel:-welcome glasses of champagne and a little chocolates! I downed two glasses before we went upstairs! No one rolled their eyes when I came down on a regular basis to take more chocolates-Great air-conditioning in the room -you know us Americans…-excellent soap, bath gel, bath salts and lotion in the room-turn down service and complimentary waters every day. -room 304. We had a lovely view overlooking the outside terrace and bar below us. -we took advantage of the pool on the sixth floor. Very small but water temperature was perfect and the lounge chairs were great and the towels fluffy & large. -excellent service by the staff. Are only request it was not honored was that we needed a lint brush for my fiancé's pants and the concierge was unable to find one. A recommendation: have one available. -wonderful service at the outside bar where we enjoyed a bottle of cava and a bottle of delicious Spanish white. Complimentary potato chips which we devoured as well!-whoever complained on Trip Advisor about their breakfast was just mean! The food choices, quality and quantity were outstanding- everything we wanted was available plus desserts! Desserts for breakfast!

The showers were huge and cotton amenities were provided, living up to the hotel's name. The lobby/restaurant were beautifully decorated with 5 star service. There's history to the hotel as well (cotton was used here for textiles) and the library was beautiful. Their specialty cocktails were very good, and the breakfast buffet was a great continental breakfast that included mint water and green juices.

These rooms are larger than the base Madras rooms which must be very small. There is a beautiful roof deck with pool, and bar with a view of the city including the Sagrada de Famiglia. The hotel is within walking distance to the La Rambla, El Born and many other neighborhoods. Our favorite meals were at El National, a cool food hall. We also liked Tapeo in the Born neighborhood for Tapas. There is a good Italian restaurant very close to the hotel called Luigi if you need a break from Tapas.

We arrived really late, close to midnight, and were still able to check in with a portable crib already set up and ready to go for our son--it was the cutest crib too by the way, in the style of bus! Our son slept so well in it, as did we, because those blackout shades are amazing! They also provided extra towels, and baby bathtub and baby bath kit for us, which was great!The room was comfortable with a king bed, water kettle which came in handy for making our son's meals, and a nice quiet balcony overlooking the courtyard.

Ok back to the hotel, we stayed in a junior Suite, however it was effortless, the reception staff are excellent, on the ball, when entering the room, is clean, spacious, and the bed was ernomous. However, be warned there is a huge bit of glass separating the room from the bathroom, so if you're not comfortable in being erhum...in the nude in front of your loved one, then this hotel might not be the one for you....also in the bathroom, you have a walking in wet room shower, and a bath....wheres the toilet....well its behind or adjacent to the front door, took me 20 minutes to find it, I thought we'd been burgled and some strange weirdo had nicked the karzee. It had everything, be warned the air con is Fresh...it works, really well. Flat screen tv is temperamental but the late night bed fold down service is great too. my girlfriend loved the chocolates they popped on the pillow as we returned from our night out. Overall you'll be hard pushed to find a better hotel, The Pool area on the 9th Floor, get there early, to avoid disappointment, there are only 9-10 bean bag sun loungers which is a shame, The bar opens at 11am till midnight so any drinks you would like to drink prior to this time you have to go to the lobby and bring back up to the 9th. Pool area. The photo of the pool area makes that area look larger than it is. The food is great, the club sandwich is a must between meals and the breakfast caters for all, Pancake Rolls and Chicken Wings for breakfast.....ermmm maybe not but they are on offer, as well as Spanish Cold Meats and Cheese, Hot food, breads and marmaldes/jams. Ok a cab to the Ramblas area costs EUR 6.00 form the hotel or a 30 minute walk at a leisurely pace down Carrer Blames....just outside the hotels.

The hotel offers free (but not terribly fast) wi-fi as well as an ethernet connection in the rooms.We didn't make use of the lobby bar or the restaurant but we did spend the last couple of hours before our flight home on the roof terrace where they really have made the most of the space available with a pool and sun loungers, cafe seating and a fully stocked bar.

We arrived a few hours before check-in time but the front desk staff got us checked-in and were extremely helpful and friendly. We stayed in room 212 (on second floor) with a view of the harbour. The room was clean and comfortable with a nice view. The furnishings are more modern not the traditional hotel style furniture. At night we could hear the traffic but that did not bother us or keep us awake at night. Hotel location is great, close to shopping and restaurants (all with walking distance) with a hop-on hop-off bus stop just across the street. When I booked the hotel I told them that they were the start of our 40th wedding anniversary vacation and hoped we could have a room with a nice view. We not only got that but on the first night the hotel delivered to us a complementary bottle of wine with chocolate covered strawberries and a slice of chocolate cake. Totally unexpected and a really nice touch of class by this hotel.My wife and I are very selective about the quality of hotels we stay at, only 4 star or higher. The H10 Port Vell has a 4 star rating and is definitely that or slightly higher. The only con we had was the price of the buffet breakfast (23 Euro each) with limited selection. We ate there the first morning but I would recommend walking to one of the close-by restaurants. The day before we were to board the cruise ship, I asked the front desk about getting a taxi the next day. They asked what time we wanted to be picked-up and made all the arrangements. The next morning our taxi was waiting for us at the front door. I would highly recommend this hotel and it is great a pre-cruise hotel being so close to the cruise terminal. The location is great and the staff so friendly and helpful. The taxi ride from the airport to the hotel cost about 40 Euro and from the hotel to the cruise terminal 20 Euro.Overall I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.

I did not give a 5 for a couple of reasons. The front desk staff is not very friendly and, in particular, Francesc was condescending both on the day we checked in, and the day we checked out. Overall, that did not affect our experience much, but it is something they could work on none the less. Also, the housekeeping staff was very pleasant, but only 3 of 6 days did we have turndown service, which, again, not a big deal, but is part of the price. Also, two of the days, we returned from our long day outside the room and at 5pm, it had not been made up. This was annoying because the cleaning cart was camped outside our room, all day, everyday--yet our room is last? I tip the cleaning service everyday, so it could not be that. It probably explains our difficulty on the first day. We got there at 11 and asked if early checkin was possible. The woman at the desk said, ""the cleaning people are outside your room now, so it should be an hour or less."" Well, we came back in an hour and a half, still not done. This was the time she reminded us, in a teachy, condescending way, that check-in time is 3pm. Uh, we know, you told us we could check in earlier. So, we left and came back at around 230, still not done. This is when Francesc mansplained that the check in time was 3. So, we knew that and if you had told us at 11 that it was firm, we wouldn't have checked back twice. But, on a positive side, the room was gorgeous . The staff and pool on rooftop bar is great. Many hours spent reading, swimming etc. up there. The grotto pool is peaceful and very therapeutic. We walked to almost everything we wanted to do or took very inexpensive cab rides. Our hotel was so convenient that we could do a thing, come back, rest etc, and do another thing later. Also, the bell staff was tremendous. Alex , in particular, was friendly, attentive, got us cab to airport on last day and...key, pushed the button for my floor when coming home at 1030 with gelato in both hands to bring to the room! Gelato open till 11 across the street!. Anyway, highly recommend the hotel. the beginning comments are more to suggest they work on that. I received an email from the hotel for a survey. I did it online and when I finished, I got a message that someone from that room on those dates had already responded.

We thoroughly enjoyed ending our day with a nightcap at the rooftop lounge - view were spectacular and we loved the vibe. We did eat here one evening and the food was tasty as well. The one and only downfall was the hotel is over the underground train and it definitely shakes the hotel. We did have to change our room after the first day or two and it was much better.

At check in we mentioned to Monika that we were traveling for my husbands birthday, so they upgraded us to a room with a great view of Las Ramblas. We arrived a little before 12, expecting to store our bags and return at 3 to check in. Monika said they could have the room ready in a half an hour, so we left our bags and took a walk through the neighborhood. When we returned, our bags were already in our room and it was ready to go. Is there anything better after a long flight that an amazing shower? Well, this hotel has the perfect shower! Although the bed looked inviting at that point, Barcelona awaited. Monika had annotated a map for us to get our bearings (it was so helpful!) so we headed off. By the time we returned to the hotel almost 12 hours later, we we so ready to enjoy a long sleep in the hotel's amazing bed. The curtains are blackout and the lighting is completely adjustable, so we slept in until almost 10 am. The hotel is extremely quiet, despite being right where the action is. The next afternoon we spent on the rooftop deck, using the pool and having cava and snacks lounging on the Bali beds on the roof. Great views and yummy food, especially the tapas. We also utilized the spa/massage pool and sauna, which felt great on our aching muscles. This hotel doesn't miss a beat when it comes to customer service and all of those nice touches (robes, slippers, in room tea kettles, nice lighting, etc.) that jet lagged travelers appreciate.

The staff is professional and courteous, and the building is grand. To me, however, the rest was lacking. I read another post where the reviewer said the hotel was lacking passion. I think that is a great way to describe it. I was genuinely disappointed, perhaps because I had expected something much better. And maybe because I've stayed in a phenomenal hotel in Barcelona and I had something else to compare it to. In the 2 times I've visited Barcelona, I've stayed at the H10 Cubik and the Hotel 1898, and I will say that I made the mistake of booking 1898 and not returning to the Cubik.The two hotels are relatively close in price. I think I paid around $300 for a room at the 1898, and the same weekend a room at the Cubik was around $265. Both hotels are within a 10-minute walking distance to Placa Catalunya, and all of the best sights. But, in my experience, the Cubik surpassed the 1898 in every way.I was returning to Barcelona after a side trip to Seville. I wanted to stay in the city for a couple of days before returning to visit friends about an hour outside the city. When my husband and I had traveled to Barcelona last Christmas Break, I had narrowed my search between the Cubik and 1898. I ended up choosing the Cubik. So, upon my return, I thought, why not try the other? I'm glad I only stayed two nights because I would have been sorely disappointed had we stayed the week there.I arrived around 9:30 off the AVE from Seville. Check-in was easy and the front desk employee was very pleasant and professional. I checked into my room on the fourth floor. It was dark, very warm, and had practically no view. They did, however, leave a nice welcome card and some desserts. I assumed the Air Conditioning was key activated, so I left my key in the slot, turned down the air to cool the room, and went up to the roof top to eat a late dinner.As soon as you step off the elevator you are almost accosted by the host of the restaurant. Are you a guest? What are you here for? They sat me at a bench table with a view of a darkened city (not at all what I had expected). The waiters all assumed I spoke English (as from what I gauge the majority of the guests use as their first language). I do speak English, but I also speak Spanish. I would've liked to converse in Spanish, seeing as I was in Spain, but never once did anyone ask for my preference. Even if I started the conversation in Spanish, the would often switch to English. Although, I wasn't 100% sure my waiter spoke Spanish. This was my first indication that I had picked a complete tourist trap. I guess I should've realized this before since the location is on La Rambla, but the hotel had such great reviews and pictures I tried it anyway. The meal on the roof was the most expensive meal I had in all of Spain. It was good, and the langostinos with tamarind sauce were delicious. I didn't finish the tomato bread (a first for me) because it was saturated in olive oil. I drank a $15 mojito and it was just ok.After dinner, I returned to my room. It was now around 11:30pm and I had an excursion leaving early the next morning. When I got to my room it was still a furnace. I called the front desk. They told me to turn down the thermostat, even though I told them I already did. She told me to look at the one in the closet. I hung up and saw that there was not another one in the closet. I called back. I waited 10 minutes for someone to return my call. An employee came up, reset the fuse, told me to wait 15 minutes and call back. I called after 15 minutes and told him it was still very warm. He told me to wait. He called after another 15 or so minutes and told me they would relocate me to another room for the night while they tried to fix the air. It was nearing midnight and I was exhausted after a long day of travel. He helped me carry my bags to a room on the third floor. It was a bit brighter than the previous, and fortunately, cooler. It also had an odor that smelled like standing water coming from the bathroom. I was so tired and didn't want to sound like one of those people who always complain, because that it definitely not me, so I just accepted the room. I asked him what I was supposed to do in the morning. He said I could take my luggage back to the old room or to the front desk because if they fixed the air they would put me back in the old room (where I had forgotten my welcome treats--I never did get to try them). I informed him that I'd be gone most of the day, and wasn't looking forward to returning and having to move rooms again. Could I not just keep this room? He said I could talk to them in the morning. He was very professional, and I think it probably wasn't his decision to make.So by 12:30, I was in bed, and already feeling regret over my choice of hotel. I will say that the bed was phenomenal. It was extremely comfortable and welcoming. There was a lot of technology in the room, but not a lot of it worked, notably the radio on the bedside. I decided to write an email to guest services in hopes that they would read it and understand the situation especially since I wasn't going to be there during the day.In the morning I advised the front desk clerk and she said I was fine to just stay in the current room and she was sorry. I did not elect to eat the $36 breakfast, and I went next door to Starbucks. Upon returning from my excursion I returned to my room but the key didn't work. It was still connected to the old room. I had to go back down and get it changed. The room still had a bad odor, and I found that high end toiletries did not include conditioner, which was a bit frustrating. Since they apparently cater to Americans, I would expect them to have conditioner. The H10 Cubik provided it.It was still bright outside so I decided to have a drink by the pool. Again, as soon as I got off the elevator, I was met with a waiter asking me (again in English) what I was doing. Was I guest? Was I going to the pool? A Drink? It was a little uncomfortable. The majority of the rooftop deck is the restaurant. The most picturesque portion included. So it's not like you can just lounge around at any old spot. The pool is a relatively small part. The actual pool was a decent size for Barcelona. The view is nice, but not nearly as nice as at the terrace of the Cubik. When I went back to my room, I heard a frustrated couple talking about how hot their room was. I assumed this was more of a widespread problem. For $300/night, you would think that this would not be an issue.So, again, I slept in the lovely bed, woke up the next day and checked out. The H1989 just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I was definitely disappointed, especially for the level of luxury it markets itself as. If you want an amazing hotel in the heart of Barcelona with a comfortable, trendy rooftop, and a breathtaking view, go to the H10 Cubik not the 1898.",3,A Bit of a Disappointment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d506158-r508857586-Hotel_1898-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,StLGrl85

So I booked this hotel based on its reviews, position and general description and was hoping for a bit of decadent luxury in great location....we got it!!La Rambla is bustling at any time of day or night but step through the doors of the hotel and you enter a large luxurious open lobby with sofas and decor reminiscent of old colonialism (in a good way) It reflects the building's heritage as an old tobacco company building.The staff were very welcoming, professional and helpful both at check in and out and for advice on good places to eat and city transport. Our room on the 6th floor was a classic room and therefore not huge but plenty big enough and decorated in a cool and relaxing style. The bed was HUUGE and I have to say, having not been sleeping well of late, I had the best 3 nights sleep in a long time!I took advice of other reviews and asked for a quiet room which means it faces away from the noise of La Rambla. The only slight gripe I have is that we seemed to be directly under one of the roof top bar's speakers and whilst the music was by no means loud and didn't at all affect our nights ( by the time we went to bed it was off), the rather monotonous and repetitive music choice did intrude on my siesta ( yep...us over 50s like an afternoon nap!) but earplugs came to the rescue.Talking of the rooftop bar and pool, another well presented area with a selection of comfy loungers round the bar and attentive staff to seat and serve you. Great view from up on the roof. If it's a bit too hot up there, then the underground vaulted roof spa pool provides another area of quiet escape with lovely aromas ,mood lighting and a selection of water jets to soothe the mind and body, particularly the aching feet after a long day of sightseeing. We didn't eat in the hotel only because we like to explore and find new experiences. The food did look good up in Bar Isabella on the roof. Breakfast looked gorgeous but we felt a tad expensive and having usually stuffed ourselves the night beforehand, we needed nothing more than a coffee and a pastry which we picked up from the Carrefour literally 2 mins round the corner (they also do gorgeous fruit slushies there..all sorts of flavours)So would I recommend Hotel 1898? Absolutely. It's not cheap, it's not meant to be...this is a luxurious hotel in a fabulous spot and if it's a special place for a special occasion you are after, look no further.....loved it....oh and so did my surprised hubs!!

That said, I'm sure the hotel breakfasts are probably superior quality.We also had some drinks at the rooftop bar a few times and that was awesome to enjoy the views and relaxing atmosphere.The hotel is by the busy Las Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya, so very central and walking distance to all the interesting areas, as well as being about 2 minutes walk from where the tour buses depart. Special thanks to the hotel manager and front office assistant who helped with the dentist recommendation.The spa pool area and shower downstairs made it very convenient to have a few relaxing hours after checking out and being refreshed before a long flight. 10/10!

Loads of options to spend time lounging in and outdoors, with two pools, a small gym, spa and sauna, restaurant, cafe and bars. If you can manage to book a day bed on the roof - the view with a cocktail in hand is a worthy one! It's simply magical to see the sun go down and the city light up!The rooms were a little on the small side, but the plush beds made up for it. Great to get a good night's sleep!The amenities in the room were also great and really appreciated the jug and tea selection in the room, as well as bathrobes for lounging. One confusion was that the staff opened our door to come in on more than one occasion without knocking, which was a little intrusive. It happened almost 4 times during our 3 night stay, and not sure if this is the norm? Aside from that, I would highly recommend this hotel - especially if you want to give yourself a treat, and spend it with loved ones.

It is right by the Plaza de Catalunya and close distance to La Rambla street. We joined the Viator day tour and it was a short 7 mins to walk to the gathering point (musee de la musica) and 15 mins from where they left you (La Pedrera) where along the way we did great shopping. My son was asking for soccer jersey, and if you don't want to pay 90 euros for the official stuff, then the street vendors on the plaza late at the night is the way to go.We got the room with the swimming pool on the balcony. I was a bit disappointed to find out that it wasn't a jacuzzi at first, and it was too cold to use it the first day. But the 2nd day was hot, and after a long day sight-seeing, it was a good place to wind down at the roof top and chill. The key is to use the pool while the sun is still hitting the balcony (before 5:30pm in July).The part that impressed us the most is the customer service by the reception staff. There was a taxi strike from 6am to 6am on our last day, and we needed to get to the airport at 4am for our early flight. The staff suggested Cabify at first (Spain version of Uber), but my husband was cautious and wanted a Plan B. Lo and behold when we tried Cabify at 3:15am, it didn't work (couldn't locate a driver). When we talked to the front desk, they said don't worry they had Plan B ready! During the night they managed to arrange us a private car to the airport.

Very friendly and helpful, as should be expected.Came up to my room, ""junior suite"", and the first thing that came to my mind was how small it was.

Room was very nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Free WiFi was fast and reliable, and there is a Nespresso machine in the room as well. I got a welcome gift that consisted of a nice bottle of Cava and fresh fruits to go with this. Very nice of the hotel, and unexpected! The hotel is located perfectly, and you are within walking distance to most of the touristy things. As long as you don't mind walking a bit, everything is within 30min. Right opposite to the hotel there are a large shopping centre.The hotel offers ,free of charge, a buffet from 14:00 - 23:00 that has hot and cold food, sandwiches, smoothies, snacks etc etc. Really good! Breakfast was of the buffet style, with the option to order eggs anyway you want. Selection was ok, but overall I found the breakfast to be a bit of a disappointment. One thing that I find in many hotels, is design before function. And it was the same here when it came to the shower. Even tho there is a door and a ledge that is supposed to stop the water from coming out, and forming a water pool on the floor. It does not work, so every time after a shower, I had a pool of water outside the shower on the floor. Small thing, I know, but I just find it annoying that design goes before function in these kind of things.

Room are clean and good size, I've asked for a quiet one which I got! Only thing is quiet = sad view but in that case I prefer my sleep quality.It was our anniversary and I mentioned it in my booking, a bottle of wine was there for us and I want to thank the hotel for that, very kind and generous! Really appreciated!What I really liked is the terrace and the swimming pool! The waitress Serena is really nice, and she is very patient despite the group that were next to us ( almost rude and noisy). The swimming pool is good to refresh yourself but not big enough for a real swimmer who likes to do length!Only thing that I found a shame is that you can't order food for meal before 1pm in the lobby.. It was Saturday around 11am, we ordered 2 breakfast formulas ( juice coffee and sandwiches) friends joined us and ordered juice coffee and took sandwiches as well. When we went to pay, the waiter charged my friend for each order( one coffee, one juice, one sandwich) because our friend did not mentioned the breakfast formula despite the fact that they had exactly the same as us.... We tried to explained that it is not very goodwill but he ignored us...Overall it was a nice stay and except this waiter the rest of the staff is nice and efficient.",4,Nice place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10127321-r502811510-The_Corner_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,Travelivor

Our room was clean, modern and felt like brand new and the bed was SO comfortable I never wanted to leave.We had breakfast the next day thinking it was included in our room price (it wasn't) so that was an additional price, but it was very good and our fault for not checking. The hotel even has a rooftop pool which is a nice bonus on a hot day as the location is central and not near the beach.

The other downside is the large garbage bins situated just adjacent to the hotel entrance, positioned so you alight from your taxi right next to them.Not recommended for large business groups (unless maybe you are a business student needing wi-fi), as the hotel does not have extensive meeting facilities.

The hotel was quiet for being on the street too.My only negative had to be the roof top pool. It is lovely up there but only has 4 sun loungers which were impossible to get and once someone did they stayed on all day. The rest of the seating is a mixture of table and chairs and deck chairs which were very uncomfortable to try and sunbathe in. I'm not sure why there aren't more sun loungers if it's for space most people were using two decks anyway. One for sitting on and one for legs!The second negative was the pool bar service, we were lucky if bar tender came up once and when he did he waited until he got a lot of orders then got the elevator down 7 floors to bring up your drink. This took about an hour from ordering! We also ordered some tapas to the roof which took about 1 hrs 30 mins to arrive. It's a silly way of doing it. Would be better to not offer the service and let people take their own drinks to the pool , which people were doing.

From when we arrived to when we left the service was excellent. We had a superior room which while not spacious had one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in, a lovely bathroom and a large flatscreen tv (albeit every Chanel was Spanish but we were in Spain lol), the tv did have youtube and an HDMI in so you could watch stuff for the web or plug something in if you wanted. There was also a window which opened onto a small ledge. The bar done fantastic cocktails and had a well thought out selection of spirits and beers. The rooftop pool was fantastic to go and chill out on after a day of sightseeing. We didn't have dinner at the hotel but did have breakfast one morning which was excellent also, great selection of continental, cooked, pastries and even a selection of sandwiches and cakes, we pinched a couple of raspberry muffins on the way out to have with coffee in the afternoon! Location wise the hotel is in a central part of town, minutes walk from Passé de Gracie with its designer shops and Gaudi exhibits and also where the tourist buses stop. It's about 5 minutes in a cab (€7) from the hustle and busily of La Ramble and 10 minutes (€11) from the port and Barceloneta.

The location is great, and the rooftop pool has beautiful views and was the perfect way to relax at sunset between sightseeing and dinner each night. However, we had several bad experiences with service from the employee working the evening shift at the front desk. First, we went to the beach and were unable to find a taxi, and since Uber is unavailable and the local taxi app wasn't finding a taxi, we called the hotel and asked them to call one for us. They refused, twice, even after we gave our exact location and said we were trying to make it back for their 7-8 wine hour. We ended up spending an hour walking around before we finally got a taxi. Then, when we made it back to the hotel just after 8, we asked if we could still get a glass of wine even though we just missed the wine hour, which was the least they could have done after they refused to call us a taxi, and they said no. We relaxed at the pool for a bit, then showered and found that it was backing up and flooding the bathroom. When we called to ask for a new room, they wanted to come see the issue first. We insisted on getting a new room immediately since we were trying to make it to dinner and were clearly in the middle of getting ready, but even once the person from the front desk came to the room, she wanted to come in and see the issue first. We insisted that we just move to a new room, which thankfully they let us do.The wine hour is a great concept, but was not executed well. In addition to being inconsiderate and not offering us a drink when we got back late due to the taxi issue, they were often running out of wine and cheese halfway through the hour and would not put more out even when asked. Also, the laundry room would be a nice amenity, but it took almost two hours to dry a small load of clothes in the dryer, which delayed our plans for the day.Overall, this hotel has a great boutique concept with an outstanding rooftop view, but unfortunately does not executed their vision fully.",3,"Could be great, but service is poor",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7138272-r502469657-Yurbban_Trafalgar_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,rjgale

Improvements: Tea kettle in the room. For almost $200 USD a night there ought to be one. The wine and cheese social is a great concept. However, the setup doesn't work well since people are sitting next to the cheese and wine -- it felt very intrusive when taking a bit of cheese or wine.

I recommend taking different routes through the quaint alleys and popping in boutiques along the way. Also, Café Lolea (the famous Spanish Sangria) is just behind the hotel, I recommend stopping in for a drink and some meat/cheese.Perks: There is a wine hour from 7 – 8 pm, which is a great way to decompress. There is free laundry and laundry soap on site that you can use if needed.

Cocktails are a little pricey but wine at the rooftop bar is 3-4 euro. It's a great place to make a lot of English speaking friends. After our daily rooftop relaxing and siesta we made it down to the complimentary wine and cheese tasting from 1900-2000. We had so much fun ""tasting wine"", which in reality was drinking wine. They advertised a free wifi box which we wish we knew ahead of time since we had pre-bought one. They also advertise breakfast which isn't included, or wasn't included in our room.

As we had experienced booking difficulties with an alternative Spanish hotel prior to departure, we chose this hotel mainly for the ease in booking the accommodation on the hotel website, roof top pool and reasonable price. We were made to feel very welcome. Lenin is a credit to the hotel, nothing was too much trouble and on the whole all staff were very helpful. We had a good breakfast in the hotel on two occasions, however we preferred to eat out, in order to soak up the atmosphere of the city. Although the pool was not large, it was adequate for cooling down and also provided an alternative area to relax within the perimeter of the hotel. My daughter and I shared a room on the sixth floor, facing out towards the city street. We benefited from a large window and a well proportioned a/c room. My son's room being on the opposite side of the corridor, which faced into an inner court yard was less big with a smaller window although it appeared to suit his needs. Three tips I would recommend for a short stay in Barcelona. Because of the heat, we found using the local city bus, a good way to commute to different areas. As a family we are use to walking but even 20 minutes in the heat can be exhausting. Get a good guide book, that can recommend restaurants etc. It saves on the arguing and time and can often lead you away from the conventional establishments catering for the tourists, enabling you to experience more local food and tradition. Take advice from the reception, we were advised to book the La Sagrada Familia Basilica early, a wise decision, a memorable experience that should not be missed. We unfortunately were not able to savour all of what Barcelona had to offer therefore a return trip is definitely on the cards and we would certainly stay in this hotel again.",5,A short break to Barcelona with my son and daughter,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4569039-r509274322-Olivia_Balmes_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,jm6442017

Walking distance to La Rambla. We also walked to the beach which took us about 40min. There are several restaurants close to the hotel. The room: Big, bright and comfortable. A bit different design, but we liked it. Big bed so we could all three sleep in it without a problem. Breakfast:The only downside with this hotel. The breakfast is simple and NOT worth the money. There are cafes and restaurants nearby that you can easily go to even if the kids are so hungry that they can't wait. Pool: Small but great. Love the sunseats inside the pool. They also give you a towel and it's close to the gym. The pool area also have an bar. Our 3-year old loved it and so did we. Unfortunately there is no view here, what so ever.Service: Greaaaaat!

We had a wonderful time. The service was consistently excellent. The staff went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay. The room was large by European standards, and nicely decorated. The bed was big (king size, I think), and very comfortable. The air conditioning worked well, and it was so nice to come back to our nice, cool room after a day of wandering around Barcelona. Our room had a small balcony, with a chair, small table and a pull-out drying rack for drying swimsuits. We weren't expecting the balcony, and it was a real bonus.The pool and the rooftop terrace were what really sealed the deal for us. The pool wasn't huge, but definitely big enough for several people to be hanging out in it. It was metal, rather than tiled, and was lovely. It had 4-5 metal loungers under water, so was great for cooling off while sunbathing. There were many lounge chairs around the pool, and we never had a problem finding one. There were also tables and chairs in the shade. The pool area had a bar, that served drinks as well as light meals and tapas. Very nice! On the opposite side of the roof terrace, there were additional chairs and sofas, and we hung out there at times, as well. Great for watching the sun set.The location is great - only a block from La Rambla, with lots of great shopping and restaurants. When we were hungry, we just walked a few minutes from our hotel. Every place we tried had great food. We really enjoyed our stay here. We kept talking about how happy we were with our choice of hotel.

The staff are trained really well and they could'nt be nicer or more helpful which makes such a difference. The hotel is impeccably clean. We had a lovely room, the shower was amazing, they left a little plate of fruit and cake for us on the second day which is a nice touch. There is a fab rooftop pool, not a huge amount of sunloungers but really relaxing and it gets the sun right up until sunrise. The staff like I said are wonderful across the board. Is it cheap, no but you pay for what you get and it's not overly expensive either. Lovely for a weekend break. Location wise you are in the Eixample area and 20 mins walk brings you down to the busier shopping / la rambla area.

It could be hard to find, the sign discreetly hidden behind some trees - but the staff are terrific (and have perfect English), the decor is imaginative, the aircon was a blessing, and there were ingenious touches - like having the aircon in the bathroom set to a higher temperature, and having a little motion-sensitive light by the toilet, so you don't have to turn on the light if you have a call of nature in the middle of the night. It had the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on! It was so handy, too, to have the vending machine right outside my door. I liked my private balcony, and that the hotel had a pool.Cons: the price for the room, the price for breakfast (€15?!), and the fact that the crisps in the vending machine aren't heavy enough to activate the release mechanism of the machine, so you have to get someone from reception to rescue them!

On 3 different occasions we went up for drinks at the pool and found ourselves waiting a long time to get drinks (20-25 minutes from time of ordering). Usually there was one nice bartender who just moved way to slow. Also I came to the pool one morning at 1030am and it was filthy with stuff floating on surface. I was surprised it hadn't been cleaned from the day before. Close to a 5 star but not quit.

Service standards throughout the hotel were superb, with the tone set by a warm and personalised greeting upon arrival (accompanied by complimentary cava), followed by a tour of the hotel's smartly designed and beautifully furnished public areas, including the wonderful rooftop plunge pool/ bar area which offers panoramic views over the harbour and the many mega yachts moored there. Despite it being quite crowded at times because of private functions there, we always managed to find a seat to sample the excellent range of drinks on offer.  While we didn't eat breakfast in the hotel's Michelin star restaurant, El Informal, we enjoyed two excellent dinners there with the food, wine and service all top tier. The Serras' location is perfect to explore the historic Gothic Quarter and adjoining El Born area, which both contain a multitude of shopping and dining options (be sure to visit the Picasso Museum which is only a few minutes’ walk from the hotel and is well worth the queue time). We also walked through the winding alleys and laneways of this historic part of town to the city centre, Eixample and the city's main high end shopping strip along Passeig de Garcia. Despite all its pluses, including above all it's superb staff, our stay at the Serras didn't quite match that of some of the other similar standard properties we booked such as the Mercer in Seville because of the very compact room we were allocated. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have booked a Grand Deluxe room (which we viewed since a friend was staying in this category), rather than a Superior Room, as we found the latter MUCH too cramped to comfortably accommodate us and our luggage. As a side note our room featured a different layout to the Superior room photos depicted on the hotel's website (and certainly felt smaller than the promoted 30 sq. m size) so am uncertain as to whether they have different categories of this room type, as ours certainly didn't have enough space to contain a 2-seater sofa at the end of the bed as the website depicts. Also on our last night water began leaking from the bathroom ceiling onto the floor, however to the hotel's credit this was rectified by the time we returned from dinner. We would definitely stay at the Serras if visiting Barcelona again but for the reasons above would select the larger and more expensive room category, as all rooms feature excellent double glazing and super comfortable beds, resulting in a good night's sleep.HIGHLY RECOMMEND - with a more expensive room choice!",4,GREAT – though our room size was far far TOO SMALL !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7142609-r500608367-Hotel_The_Serras-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,MoreFunForever

We cannot say enough about how disappointed we were with this hotel and do not recommend anyone stay there. On the first day after an 8 hour night flight we arrived at 9:30am and were told they would put a rush on having our room prepared. At 11:30am when we enquired about our room we were then told that the previous guests had not checked out yet and they had until noon to do so. At 1:00 we enquired again and were told that check-in was 2pm and we would have to wait and guaranteed the room would be ready by then. The room was not ready until after 2:00 (so much for putting a rush on the room). We had booked a sea view room for over 800 Euros and find we are on the 3rd floor facing trees and have absolutely no view at all. When we later enquired about this they said any room on the sea side was considered a sea view room. They did give us a reduced rate (600+ Euros) after complaining. At 6:30 pm the same day we receive a call from the front desk asking when we are checking out the next day as the hotel is very busy and we responded we would let them know in the morning. After a long day of travel we decide to go to bed early and at 10pm are awaken by another call from the hotel asking when we will be checking out the next day.

I had a million questions prior to arrival. I would email and get instant responses. Anastasia was always ready with an answer. The staff organized dinners and trips prior to our arrival which made everything go so smoothly.We were greeted by Jan as soon as the cab pulled up (they do have a car that will pick you up, but the cab is cheaper). He brought up our bags clearly loving his job. Jan also went out of his way to come to our room with recommendations, as he knew we were off to Begur. Other amazing receptionists were Daniella and Sergio. Meziane, who worked the rooftop bar, was so fun and interesting to talk to. And then there was SANDRA. I just loved her. I asked for coffee with half and half. She didn't know what that was and we laughed and laughed as I explained our strange American ways. Then she brought me half milk and half cream in different containers. And the next morning - there she was - waiting with my coffee! What a dream.There were many other wonderful staff - I missed some of their names - give them all a raise! Everybody had a smile at all times.The room - gorgeous. We had the standard room. It wasn't huge, but it was just perfect. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in! Big fluffy pillows - and great towels and robes. There was a small terrace where I hung my bathing suits to dry. The bathroom was brilliant. The shower was huge and had an awesome spray. There were 2 sinks, allowing my husband and me to have plenty of room.The restaurant - We only ate breakfast. Very good food and again - Sandra made the meal special.The gym- Small and complete with anything you need - treadmill, elliptical, some weights. There were also yoga mats.The ROOFTOP- the best part. We just loved it. The pool is small, but just big enough for what you need. No, you can't do laps, but yes, you can cool off. There are lovely, cushioned chairs and waiters to attend to your needs. The cold water was a great touch. No need to bring water bottles. You can have tapas as a snack - I do believe they also serve lunch. TOUCHES - There was a bottle of champagne in our room waiting! As it turns out, we don't drink champagne - only wine. So they swapped it out! HOW NICE!

The front desk staff was super helpful and housekeeping was perfect. I had a snafu where I left a bag in the backseat (should have put it in the trunk!) of the taxi that dropped us at the airport. I realized it about 15 minutes after being dropped so the taxi was long gone. My only hope of getting it back was that the hotel would be able to reach the driver since they had booked the taxi for us. Believe it or not, when I called him, the hotel concierge facilitated tracking down the driver who came back to the airport and the bag was returned to me. Service above and beyond my expectations!

Noah greeted us on arrival with a choice of complementary drinks and proved very helpful in explaining the layout of the city and the hop on hop off bus.As others have reported - this hotel was super clean with lovely bedrooms and huge bathrooms with 'his and hers' sinks and showers. The rooms are equipped with coffee maker, hair dryer, shampoos, conditioner, emergency shaving kits and large clean towels. There was also complementary water and a couple of bottles of Sangria.Throughout our stay the atmosphere of the hotel was very relaxed. On a summers evening we would highly recommend relaxing on the roof terrace with a drink in hand watching the stars come out as the night falls. If you don't want to eat in there are many many restaurants serving all sorts of dishes within easy walking distance.We mentioned on checking in that it was a very special birthday visit for my wife which was why we were in Barcelona - late afternoon on the day the hotel delivered a complementary bottle of champagne, small cake and card - absolutely amazing. Thankyou to all the team at the Casa Mimosa.The service didn't stop there - on our last day we were due to be picked up 20 minutes after the breakfast restaurant opened which didn't leave much time to order and eat. So what did the waitress and Chef do? .... they took our order the day before and had our breakfast plated up and piping hot the moment we walked in at 7am.

There are plenty of good restaurants close by. There is a fantastic bakery around the corner in Hotel Praktik which does amazing (and very reasonably priced) pastries for breakfast, and delicious baguettes for a packed lunch if you're going out for the day (2 pastries, 2 filled baguettes, a fruit pot and a cake came to only 15 euros!). There is a small shop a few streets away (a few doors up from the Tiasanta restaurant) that sells chocolate churros which are to die for! There is a 24 hour supermarket next door where you can buy water, drinks, extra milk for coffee/tea, snacks etc. The hotel is beautifully decorated, and spotlessly clean. The pools and sun loungers are lovely. The courtyard is peaceful with shady areas to sit if the sun is too hot. The roof terrace has amazing views, including La Pedrera. The room was an excellent size, with a lovely big bathroom with double shower. The toiletries were great too. The bed was huge and so comfortable. The air conditioning worked really well. My husband took his own nespresso pods from home, so he enjoyed his morning coffees using the nespresso machine in the room (although pods were provided). There is a good sized mini fridge with we used for water, juice, milk etc. We ate lunch in the restaurant once, and it was very nice. We really enjoyed the patatas bravas. The staff, without exception, have been utterly charming and helpful with our every request. (They put a kettle and travel cot in our room when asked, brought us an iron and ironing board, made restaurant recommendations and reservations, and even left a card, cake and lovely bottle of cava in our room for my husbands birthday!). We were greeted with a glass of cava when we arrived, and there was complimentary sangria in our room. There was 2 complimentary bottles of water left in our room every day.

We cannot be more pleased with our choice. It is boutique and chic hotel to our like. First of all, its location offers us minutes of walk almost to everything that we wanted our children to see. It shares the same block with Casa Mila but tucked in the back which makes it quiet. The reception desk, though a bit short staffed and minimal, is friendly and efficient. Sebastian, our concierge, is exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly. He helped us pre-book all the tickets to parks museums and boat rides so we did not have to wait in line. All the restaurants he recommended for our lunch and dinner turned out to be exceptional. We never had a disappointing meal throughout our stay - our family are world travellers and we are all gourmet affectionados! The lounge/bar, though could be better with more choices, makes up with its openness, modern simplicity and friendly waitresses. Our two rooms, although could be a bit bigger, makes up its small size with high ceilings and large windows and garden-facing views and Gaudi's Casa Mila, Bathrooms are well furbished, lean lined but functional and with all the amenities we need. The rain shower is one of the best we've come across in many five star hotels we stayed. If we have to pick on something, we wish its pools would be bigger and more private. We also wish its restaurant would offer more varieties so for nights we decide to stay in we could have more choices. But in a city that is full of good restaurants every block, that is the least problem. Also WIFI works well in the rooms and lobby. We liked Casa Mimosa so much to the point we decided to cancel our originally book hotel in Lisbon and instead, to stay in another H10 hotel in Lisbon on our subsequent trip to Portugal.

My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Mercer Barcelona during the length of our honeymoon this past May. Though it's been close to 3 months since we've returned from our trip, we find ourselves talking about the Mercer on a daily basis. We miss it all. It's not hard to fall in love with a city like Barcelona, for us, it's become a clear favorite. But rarely, if ever, do you feel that the hotel you stayed in almost supersedes the location it's in. We are avid travelers. Yet every day, we found it nearly impossible to find the motivation to leave the hotel so we could go out and explore the city. Plenty has been said about the Mercer's understated elegance and history, all well deserved. The location, in Barri Gòtic, speaks for itself. The true beauty of this hotel, though, lies wholly in its staff. The attention to detail that goes behind every thoughtful note we found in our room each day, the Cava left for us as a surprise, the perfect room service delivery at 2 a.m., this is what makes a hotel memorable. Though it was never mentioned, the staffed figured out I would be celebrating my birthday during our stay and surprised me with cake during breakfast. My husband hasn't been able to eat pan con tomate since... nothing has come close to that 2 a.m. pan con tomate delivery. As honeymoons go, you know the time spent with your significant other will be an experience you'll remember for the rest of your life. In our case, our honeymoon became THE experience of a lifetime. We only have to thank the Mercer for helping make this happen. A huge thank you goes out to Joan Manel, Borja and Jose, at Le Bouchon (espero haya escrito tú nombre correctamente!). A todo el personal del Mercer, se les agradece enormemente. Esperamos poder verlos pronto.",5,Perfect,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3400654-r505502033-Mercer_Hotel_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,evema83

The building is a renovated apartment complex with an old exterior but contemporary interior with elegant courtyard.Service: Guest services staff were extremely solicitous and helpful with setting our itinerary--including a great walking tour guide, Mark--and making restaurant recommendations. I can't say enough good things about the entire team. They were also responsive to email requests in advance.Room: We stayed in the Mercer Suite, which has a very large living room and smallish bedroom.

A few things to consider before staying there - the rooms are a little dark with several spot lights that are well appointed in the room so please note this if you are a big reader. The pool on the roof is very small, so the photo is a bit misleading. Having said this, our two boys went up there each day to take dip while we ordered glasses of wine and looked out over the city.

They are spacious and it is a boutique hotel, so take that into account. The location of the hotel is perfect.

The hotel is right in the center of the beautiful gothic part of town, next to La Rambla, and in a beautiful traditional square with lots of cafes and shops. My wife and I sat out and read on the square for an hour each day because it was so nice. The staff take such good care of you and they don't try to nickle and dime you.

We could not have been any happier with our beautiful room and the service provided by Mayre and the rest of the Hotel DO staff. We've stayed at five-star hotels all over the world, and the level of service provided by the Hotel DO: Plaća Reial exceeds almost all. If one is a light sleeper or prefers peace and quiet, it is imperative to have ear plugs and perhaps even noise-canceling headphones. The first night I went to bed without using these, and I was awake at 4 a.m. scouting around the room to equip myself so that I could go back to sleep. People party on the Plaça Reial all night long! It is kind of strange that such a refined hotel would be on a plaza that is so much like the Latin Quarter in Paris, but there you have it. So go equipped, and you'll be okay. Once I used BOTH ear plugs, AND my Bose headphones, AND took a melatonin, I was fine -- but it truly required all three of these things to be able to get sleep.That said, the hotel provides so many lovely touches, such as complimentary tapas and wine (really, dinner!) the first night, fresh fruit every afternoon, delicious breakfast every morning, Nespresso in the room, complimentary drinks in the refrigerator -- these really do compensate for the crazy Plaća Reial -- and the location could not be more convenient for getting around Barcelona. In addition, the staff went the second and third and maybe even fourth mile getting our purchases shipped back to the U.S. to us. They even offered to have someone traveling to the U.S. bring us some souvenirs that couldn't be mailed overseas due to shipping restrictions. Our room was light, airy, restful, and beautiful.

The fact that there were only dimmed lamps in the room resulted in dodgy makeup application. Not a good look. The bed however was incredibly comfortable and I would love to order the pillows. So very soft! The rooftop and cooling off pool was lovely and basically our own private rooftop until Friday hit. This became busy, and we were happy we had plans to get out and about. There was also very loud music on the Thursday night until very late.

This hotel is really stylish and exudes exclusivity, starting with the discreet entrance. The staff are very attentive and extremely pleasant, you do feel they would do anything for you. Small touches like bottles of water etc are appreciated. Our arrival was marred however by the receptionist insisting we had booked a tiny room despite my confirmation clearly stating we had booked a large double room. She was happy to give us a large room but at a cost, stating that the 'large double room' stated on our confirmation actually meant ' large double bed' !! Anyway the manager, Pilar arrived and dealt with it immediately and professionally ensuring we had the room we booked. This exchange lasted only a short time but the Wittmore must know first impressions are crucial and having to debate about what you have booked isn't ideal. The rooms are smaller than other hotels I have stayed at but that is well documented on the website so shouldn't be a surprise, they are also extremely well appointed and the toiletries are fabulous. However there is no full length mirror or if there is I couldn't find it, which brings me to the other downside; this hotel is dark really dark and while I get it is all about the ambience it becomes rather annoying, we had trouble unlocking our door it was so dark.
